The Sonance C101 in-wall speaker is matches the construction and timbre of the CR101 and is a good speaker for both stereo in-wall scenarios and for complimenting the CR101 in a home cinema arrangement. The C101 in-wall speakers become the front left, centre and right speakers, supported by the CR101 in-ceiling speakers for the rears.

Like the CR101 speakers, the quality of sound is good. The larger woofer enables a lower frequency of 47Hz compared to 70Hz with the CR101 to give a bass note and richness that represents excellent value for money. They have a 'footprint' of 305mm diameter, the same as the Virtuoso and suit any location in the house. They are also moisture resistant and therefore ideal for kitchens.</description><g:id>CR801</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/CR801_large.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£360.00</g:price><g:mpn>CR801</g:mpn><g:brand>Sonance</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

A good companion to the Sonos Connect Amp

Speaker performance from the Sonance CR101, like any other in-ceiling speaker, can be enhanced by insulating the cavity with rockwool or fibreglass insulation. When installing speakers in a ceiling, it is best to lay a sheet of unfaced fiberglass insulation over the back of the speaker. This will also reduce transfer of sound to rooms above the speakers.

To further improve the sound quality, install insulation in the bays adjacent to the speaker location. This will reduce noise produced by the unsupported plasterboard. alternativly you can also use the Hoody Firer Retardent Acoustic Hood</description><g:id>CR101</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/CR101%201.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£125.00</g:price><g:mpn>CR101</g:mpn><g:brand>Sonance</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Like the Symphony 621SSTR it has dual dome tweeters, although in this case these are not angled. Each tweeter produces the left or right channel. Its weather resistance makes it our most popular speaker for smaller bathrooms and hallways.

Bass response improvement

Speaker performance from the Sonance CR101SST, like any other in-ceiling speaker, can be enhanced by insulating the cavity with rockwool or fibreglass insulation. When installing speakers in a ceiling, it is best to lay a sheet of unfaced fiberglass insulation over the back of the speaker. This will also reduce transfer of sound to rooms above the speakers.

To further improve the sound quality, install insulation in the bays adjacent to the speaker location. This will reduce noise produced by the unsupported plasterboard.

These speakers are well suited to Russound CAA66 and Russound CA44 or CA4 multiroom systems or with Sonos ZonePlayers.

NB. When putting in the speaker cables for this speaker do make sure that you run TWO pieces of speaker cable to the CR101SST, one for the left channel and one for the right channel.</description><g:id>CR101SST</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Sonance%20CR101SST.png</g:image_link><g:price>£126.36</g:price><g:mpn>CR101SST</g:mpn><g:brand>Sonance</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

For music anywhere in your house you just need to connect the Sonos Connect Amp to a pair of standard stereo speakers or in-ceiling speakers.

The Sonos Connect Amp  plays any music files stored on your computer (PC or Apple Mac) or on a stand alone hard drive (NAS drive), so long as the computer is attached directly to a ZonePlayer (another Connect Amp, Connect, Play1, Play3, Play5 or Playbar) or to a Bridge somewhere in your house, so that you can access the music regardless of where it is stored. The Sonos Connect Amp will also accept a line-level input from any analogue audio device that outputs on phono connectors allowing you to distribute not only your music on the computer but also audio from other conventional audio sources, such as DVD players, satellite digiboxes or even turntables with pre-amps. And you can play the same song or different songs in as many rooms as you'd like - simultaneously.

 

Sonance CR101 or Russound Acclaim RSF-64 in-ceiling speakers make a perfect compliment to the Connect Amp, for a seamless integrated audio experience.

This second RF output is also equipped to accept infra-red remote control commands sent ‘in reverse’ from the remote viewing location(s). This allows a remote digital satellite viewer the convenience of full control of the digibox.

The Global mini tvLINK Pro F101501 provides the remote infra-red receiver and coaxial cable coupler necessary to take advantage of this capability within the Sky digibox.

It can also be used with Sky, Sky Plus or SkyHD on the RF output from the digibox. The RF/TV balun saves the cost of installing expensive and bulky coax cable and is a smart, fast way of distributing RF signals.

NB: The RF/TV balun will NOT connect between your satellite dish and the digibox because the dish receiver requires power and this cannot be carried over the Cat5e cable.

The RF/TV balun works in conjunction with splitters, amplifiers and cable modems.

The MuxLab videoEase RF/TV balun uses just 2 strands of the UTP Cat5e or Cat6 cable. This means that a single Cat5e/Cat6 can carry both the downlink and the uplink from a distribution amplifier located in the loft (with 2 twisted pairs to spare).

NB. This balun will not permit Infra-red control signals to be passed over the Cat5 cable for control of connected Sky or Freesat boxes.</description><g:id>500302</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/500302.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£90.00</g:price><g:mpn>500302</g:mpn><g:brand>MuxLab</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Racks consists of two long, thin metal plates standing vertically in the same plane with a space of approximately 18 inches between them.

What is a `U`?

The vertical height of 19" rack equipment is usually a multiple of a standard unit of height called the `U`, meaning Unit. One U is 1.75 inches (44.45 mm).

The Cinemax range

These Cinemax professional 19" racks come in a range of flat packs that are easily assembled in minutes. The unique design provides the same amount of rigidity as any conventional 19" rack. They are ideal for storing multiroom equipment that is available with rack mount fittings such as the Russound CAA66, CAS44, CA4 or ABUS A-C560, multiroom controllers, Russound ST2 Twin tuner, Russound SMS Smart Media Server, or the Sonance power amp.

HOODY's meet all the UK building and IEE Regulations.

HOODY is a range of Fire and Acoustic speaker hoods that will bring all your installations into conformity with the latest IEE and Building Regulations for Fire and Acoustic integrity of ceilings. The regulations states that once a hole has been made in the ceiling for a speaker the integrity of its construction and its ability to perform in a fire is significantly reduced.

Hoody, due to its acoustic construction will also stop a large amount of backwards sound leakage from the speakers to the rooms above its location, making in-ceiling speaker installation below a child’s bedroom for example, achievable.

We suggest an Acoustic Fire hood is fitted to all ceiling speaker locations, but it is a requirement for all in-ceiling speakers that are installed below any habitable rooms or means of access or escape.

For example, a standard two storey house will require all the ground floor speaker locations to have hoods fitted. If a house has three storeys, you will need hoods on the ground speaker locations and the first floor to correctly comply with the regulations.

Please note Hoody Fire Hoods are sold Singularly.

Running conduit between points to allow cables to be installed or upgraded at a later date is not new, but the standard electrical conduit is not designed to suit terminated cables such as HDMI or VGA cables. This special system uses large - 30mm internal - diameter flexible conduit with a smooth internal surface to avoid snagging when the cable is pushed through.

The conduit kit require special UK style metal back boxes have holes pre-cut into the back box to allow a good fit of the conduit. Three back boxes are available:

Single gang with 1 Conduit Hole
Double gang with 1 Conduit Hole
Double gang with 2 Conduit Holes

The Milty banana plug body unscrews to reveal a double screw down connection (for which you will need a very small screwdriver) for the speaker cable, ensuring a good solid connection between the cable and the plug. If required you can use solder as an extra sealant but this is not usually necessary.

The 4mm banana plugs from Milty will accept the Soundflex 144 strand speaker cable or the Russound 4 core cable that we offer.

This QED WM07 twin pair of phono sockets is ideal for where you want to send line level audio, ie NON amplified audio, from one location to another. For example if you have a stereo audio device eg a CD player and you want to send the sound to an amplifier eg a multiroom controller amp such as the Russound CAS44K or Sonos ZP120 Zone Player, through cables embedded in the wall. Note that the length of such embedded cable should be no greater than 20 metres. Beyond this distance we would suggest using the MuxLab stereo audio baluns. Both of these are balun systems using Category 5e cable.</description><g:id>WM07</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/QED%20WM%2007.JPG</g:image_link><g:price>£31.50</g:price><g:mpn>WM07</g:mpn><g:brand>QED</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

This new push button version of the popular Transmatch has a unique impedence matching design, that converts a net 2 Ohm load back to a safe 4 Ohm load to protect your amplifier.  The QED SS50 product ensures that you are able to use up to five pairs of speakers in series from the same stereo amplifier to cater for your audio needs.

The terminals on the rear of the unit are marked 'A' and 'B1' - 'B4'. The 'A' pair are switched directly for the highest quality, 'B1' - 'B4' are used for the remaining connections. Suitable for amplifiers up to 60 Watts RMS with a minimum impedance loading of 4 Ohms, although higher powered amplifiers can be used providing the safe operating limits of the Transmatch are not exceeded.

By using only the 4 'B' outputs you can safely connect up to 4 pairs of 4 Ohm speakers

Suitable for use with the WM14 wall mounted volume control. Electronic overload protected.

Parallel switching ensures best quality, but be careful as two pairs of speakers at 8 Ohm will lower the impedence to 4 Ohms. Check that your amplifier can handle this, before using.

The power handling of the WM15 is 150 Watts RMS. The WM15 is suitable for use with the WM14 volume control.

The WM15 has silver plated switch contacts to minimise audio loss. Designed to suit speaker cable and working at amplified level, ie to be positioned after the amplifier, the WM15 has screw terminal connections for easily connecting speaker cable. It can handle cable up to 2.5 sq mm cross sectional area.

The WM15 two-way parallel speaker switch requires a 44mm deep UK style back box.

The WM15 two-way parallel speaker switch is mounted on the System 45 frame with a white faceplate to match the Systemline Modular multi-room audio controls.

NB: Do not mount this faceplate in a back box together with a 240V mains power socket or switch.

Alternative faceplates: System 45

Alternative faceplates are available in the System 45 range in Polished Brass, Brushed Brass and Bright Polished Chrome. See below for examples shown on the single speaker version WM09. To order click here

Series switching ensures that the load to your amplifier does not fall below 8 Ohms when using 8 Ohms speakers. This way you protect your amplifier, but the volume level will drop when both pairs of speakers are playing because the impedence (resistance) will rise to 16 Ohms instead of the normal 8 Ohms.

The WM17 has silver plated switch contacts to minimise audio loss.

It is a high quality stereo audio amplifier that is built into a standard sized UK double gang back box. It provides 20 Watts per channel RMS of amplification (when using 4 Ohm speakers) eliminating the need to make space for a conventional amplifier. It draws its own power from an externally located mains adaptor and control is by infra red remote.

The KLAB20 amplifier is ideal for single room solutions with a single input source such as an iPod dock. By connecting the iPod dock directly to the in-wall amplifier, you can create a very neat solution, dispensing with the audio input input plate of the iPort iPod dock. Wire the audio output to a pair of in-ceiling speakers (4 or 8 Ohms) to complete the package. NB. Both the KLAB20 and the iPort iPod dock come with low voltage plug-top power supplies. These can be located out of sight by using our 2.1mm DC extension leads.</description><g:id>KLABKIT</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Audio Amplifiers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Audio Amplifiers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/KLABKIT.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£111.00</g:price><g:mpn>KLABKIT</g:mpn><g:brand>Keene</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

It is a high quality stereo audio digital amplifier that can fit onto a standard standard sized UK double gang back box or a surface mount pattress box with a depth of 25mm. It provides 20 Watts per channel RMS of amplification (when using 4 Ohm speakers) eliminating the need to make space for a conventional amplifier. It draws its own power from an externally located mains adaptor and control is by buttons within the flexible front cover or by infra red remote.

The KLAB20 amplifier is ideal for single room solutions with a single input source such as an iPod dock. By connecting the iPod dock directly to the in-wall amplifier, you can create a very neat solution, dispensing with the audio input input plate of the iPort iPod dock. Wire the audio output to a pair of in-ceiling speakers (4 or 8 Ohms) to complete the package.

Alternatively, you can use the KLAB20D with another source say a computer, and just plug your MP3 player into the front for occasional use.

NB. Both the KLAB20 and the iPort iPod dock come with low voltage DC power supplies. The power supply for the KLAB is a 15V 4A DC trailing type type (eg like a laptop power supply - see photo below). If you intend permanently wiring in the power supply we would suggest using either a 2.1mm DC extension lead or an Apex 2 x DC faceplate module. The latter can also be used to provide the second extension lead for the iPort iPod dock.

This Pro-Signal HDMI cable at 0.5m long is ideal for connecting HDMI extender baluns to your TV or projector. The short length means that the balun can be stuck to the rear of your TV without having unsightly excess cable hanging down. You can also use this short cable for connecting your Sky HD box to the HDMI transmitter balun, or to the HDMI matrix itself.

Note that this cable is not HDMI 1.4 compliant so is not suitable for 1080p or 3D signals. Do not use it for connecting your Blu-ray player to the HDMI matrix as you may lose quality. For this situation we would recommend using the Key Digital HD Python cable which is High Speed HDMI with Ethernet, ie HDMI 1.4.</description><g:id>PSG1092</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Electronics Accessories &gt; Cables &gt; Coaxial Cables</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Electronics Accessories &gt; Cables &gt; Coaxial Cables</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/prosignal_HDMI.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£3.60</g:price><g:mpn>PSG1092</g:mpn><g:brand>Clearance Stock</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Your Sky box outputs a modulated signal on the RF2 output. Most Freesat boxes do not include a modulator so you need to add one to your system to distribute the signal around your home. For a wiring diagram of connections, see Labgear TV distribution amplifier wiring diagrams. Likewise Blu-ray Disc players and DVD players do NOT have built-in modulators. These require a modulator.

Even though you may have a digital (freeview) TV, all flat screen TVs (to our knowledge) include an analogue TV tuner enabling you to view a modulated signal on any TV in your home distributed using a TV distribution amplifier.

NB: This Labgear modulator has an RF 'loop-through', ie an RF input that goes straight to the RF output. This means you can use it as a combiner. For example if you are using this modulator to convert a BD/DVD output for distribution through a TV system, and combining it with say a satellite decoder RF output, eg Sky, then you can put the RF from Sky into the ANT IN, and the TV output will have both channels available for the uplink.</description><g:id>MOD111</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Components &gt; Modulators</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Components &gt; Modulators</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/MOD111.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£34.70</g:price><g:mpn>MOD111</g:mpn><g:brand>Labgear</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

A single quad LNB on a freesat (or Sky) dish will allow you to have 4 freesat TVs or 2 freesat PVRs (or 2 SkyHD boxes), but more than this and you need to use a multiswitch, which is essentially a clever splitter.

So from a technical point of view, a multiswitch combined with a Triax Quattro LNB enables many set-top box users to share a single dish/LNB installation and cabling. Everyone in the house will enjoy a full digital signal quality - from satellite to set-top box. And from an aesthetical and practical point of view, a multiswitch can help you avoid many dishes on the roof.</description><g:id>TQT007</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Triax_TQT007.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£45.00</g:price><g:mpn>TQT007</g:mpn><g:brand>Triax</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

This means that you can use your existing stereo source, eg normal stack system, micro or mini hi-fi without any additional amplifying equipment in the source room.

The A-H484 multisource hub allows you to play up to four audio sources through your A-BUS system. You can select any source independently in each zone at the keypad or with an A-LRC2 remote control. Each zone may have one or two rooms with A-K4 Amplified Keypads.

 (There is an option to buy components individually)

The ABUS Systems integrate perfectly with your iPod, iPhone, iPad Docking Station click here for details.

This means that you can use your existing stereo source, eg normal stack system, micro or mini hi-fi without any additional amplifying equipment in the source room.

Russound’s A-C660 A-BUS Controller Kit provides advanced multiroom audio system features in an installer friendly package by taking the A-BUS concept to the next stage.

Designed for easy installation and programming, it includes the A-C68 six-source, eight-zone multiroom controller.

The Russound MCA-C5 distributes eight audio sources to eight listening zones simultaneously of which six are amplified at 40W/channel and two can be put through power amps for larger areas. A built-in internal AM/FM tuner with RDS (Radio Data System) support is configured as source one.

We would normally recommend that we supply the MCA-C5 with the Russound DMS3.1 Digital Media Streamer. This then gives you three streaming sources which can be from your own music library held on a computer, Internet radio or a music service provider, AND an AM/FM tuner. This combination then totals 3 digital music streams and 2 analogue radio sources.

If you're using the speakers as surround channel speakers in a home theater, you can create a more diffuse, spacious surround effect by pivoting the tweeter towards a wall or window, away from the listeners</description><g:id>Qi65S</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/prof1_QI65S_halfgrille.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£180.00</g:price><g:mpn>Qi65S</g:mpn><g:brand>Q Acoustic Q Install</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

This also allows them to handle 120Watt output. Like the others in the range they have a 'footprint' of 232mm diameter and a flush appearance, similar in size to the Q Install Qi65C and Sonance Visual Performance range.

A good companion to the Sonos Connect Amp

You may however still need to modify the backbox to allow entry of the cable and plug.

Used in pairs, the VGA balun allows VGA video to be transmitted up to 135 metres over Cat5e, at a resolution of 640 x 480 pixels.

Other qualities of signal may be transmitted over the following distances:


	VGA: 640 x 480 pixels (15MHz) 135m
	SVGA: 800 x 600 pixels (30MHz) 105m
	XGA: 1024 x 768 pixels (60MHz) 75m
	SXGA: 1280 x 1024 pixels (100MHz) 60m



Unlike standard Passive VGA baluns the MuxLab versions do NOT require shielded Cat5e cable. The RJ45 connectors are of the shielded type and both baluns have a 'ground screw' on which to terminate shielding if you do use shielded Cat5e cable. MuxLab advice is that use in normal conditions does not require shielded Cat5e (STP) but in 'harsh electrical environments' STP cable 'may provide additional noise immunity'.

We supply a monitor side (500040) and PC side (500042) as a pair.</description><g:id>500040</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Video Transmitters</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Video Transmitters</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/balun_VGA_500040.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£126.11</g:price><g:mpn>500040</g:mpn><g:brand>MuxLab</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The MuxLab CATV Hub is available in two (2) configurations; Eight (8) ports: 500301 and sixteen (16) ports: 500304. The MuxLab RF/TV Hub works in conjunction with MuxLab's passive RF/TV Baluns (500302 and 500306) and other RF video equipment for a more complete cabling solution.

The MuxLab RF/TV (CATV) Distribution Hub has a 900 MHz bandwidth and supports Freeview, broadband Internet and Digital Cable. The product features built-in gain amplification and port buffering and may be used in conjunction with standard RF distribution equipment for larger installations.

NB: The MuxLab RF/TV Distribution Hub cannot be used between your satellite dish and the digibox because the dish receiver requires power and this cannot be carried over the Cat5e/6/7 cable. You will still need to use satellite quality co-ax cable directly between the Sky or Freesat digibox and the satellite dish.</description><g:id>500301</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Video Transmitters</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Video Transmitters</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/MuxLab_500301.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£510.19</g:price><g:mpn>500301</g:mpn><g:brand>MuxLab</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

It can also be used with Sky or Sky Plus on the RF output from the digibox. The RF/TV balun saves the cost of installing expensive and bulky coax cable and is a smart, fast way of distributing RF signals.

When used with shielded twisted pair cable, the connection supports greater RF ampliflication and therefore greater distance with less EMI/RFI egress compared to the standard MuxLab RF/TV balun (500302). The MuxLab Shielded RF/TV balun also works in conjunction with MuxLab's RF/TV Hub (500301 (8 way) and 500304 (16 way) for a total cabling solution.

NB: The MuxLab Shielded RF/TV balun will NOT connect between your satellite dish and the digibox because the dish receiver requires power and this cannot be carried over the Cat5e/6/7 cable. This balun will not permit Infra-red control signals to be passed over the Cat5 cable for control of connected Sky or Freesat boxes.

The perfectly balanced stereo sound reproduction is based on a symmetrical circuit architecture, which mirrors signal paths in the left and right channels. Superb sonic performance is delivered via two pairs of loudspeaker outputs, giving you a choice of driving separate speakers for a two zone multiroom system, or minimizing crossover distortion by independently driving bass and tweeter units.

The Marantz PM5004 integrated amplifier is the first in its class to offer the current feedback architecture, which has so far been used in far more expensive models. This technology offers very fast and accurate signal handling, which results in a very open and precise music image. The PM5004 opens the new range of Marantz integrated amplifiers and offers music lovers high sound quality and flexibility.

The PM5004 is also availalble in Available colors: Gold / Silver / Silver-Gold colour options please call for details,

Much more. Because now you can connect this superb integrated amplifier directly to a vast range of digital sources and use its superior DAC to create an unbelievably high level of audio enjoyment with new media.

Of course, Marantz have retained the pre-amp and power-amp sections that exclusively feature discrete components-not a single IC in sight of the signal path. That’s because specially selected single components not only outperform ICs in quality, the PM6005 also makes it possible to refine the sound in much more detail, resulting in more clarity and transparency. 

And of course the lower impedance shielded Toroidal transformer has been retained, as well as the customized main capacitors. And of course all of the original features - such as five-line audio input including phono, two-pairs of gold-plated speaker connections with the convenience of bi-wiring, and a remote handset - are all still there. But now, the unit includes optical and coaxial digital inputs.

The DAC is the 24bit/192kHz high current CS4398, which is already proven in many Premium Range products. And the complete digital section is fully shielded by an extra metal housing to ensure that the digital stage has no effect on the analogue signal. In short, the new PM6005 is your proven and excellent bridge to the future.

Avaialble in Gold / Silver / Black / Silver-Gold Finish, please call for other colour options</description><g:id>PM6005</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Audio Amplifiers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Audio Amplifiers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Marantz%20PM6005.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£379.00</g:price><g:mpn>PM6005</g:mpn><g:brand>Marantz</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

To enhance your system further a new software update designed specifically for custom installers to more easily integrate the Sonos PLAYBAR home theatre experience into existing home theatre systems. Sonos entered home theatre with the launch of PLAYBAR, a nine speaker soundbar that fits seamlessly into the broader wireless HiFi system. With the new software update, custom installers can use the SONOS Connect Amp to power third-party speakers as rears in combination with PLAYBAR and SONOS Subwoofer to create immersive 5.1 surround sound. This feature is now available through the latest software update.

The CONNECT:AMP is a wireless component that transforms existing speakers into a music streaming system with a high powered amplifier. This new functionality was built to serve as a simple solution for new home theatre installations or for retrofitting existing systems with in-ceiling, bookshelf or in-wall speakers.

Until recently, the PLAY:3 was the only product that functioned as rear channel speakers for the PLAYBAR. Sonos wanted to offer custom installer partners a solution that enables them to unleash TV sound with PLAYBAR and install in-ceiling or in-wall rear channel speakers to experience 5.1 surround sound and achieve the aesthetic look that their customers ask for.</description><g:id>PLAYBAR</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/playbar_angle.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£598.80</g:price><g:mpn>PLAYBAR</g:mpn><g:brand>Sonos</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

In this case, QED has provided with a small box that is capable providing an amplifier with a further auxiliary input. For example, you might have an i-Pod dock and a CD player both requiring input on the amplifier when there is only one input left that is free. The QED IX20 allows you to plug in both of these components, and the IX20 will act as a switch between them. The output of the QED IX20 2-Way Input Expander is then connected to the single, free auxiliary jack that is on the rear of the amplifier. This little unit solves the dilemma of lack of auxiliary inputs on an amplifier by acting as a switch between the two outputs of two separate pieces of audio equipment.

Gold plated connectors ensure a good contact is established between phono cable and audio components. </description><g:id>QEDIX20</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/QED%20IX20_0.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£62.50</g:price><g:mpn>QEDIX20</g:mpn><g:brand>QED</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Marantz have also added a solid metal bottom-plate and centralised the CD mechanism. This is how, Marantz virtually eliminated vibration.

In addition, the oversized power supply feeds the digital and analogue circuitry of the player, where the high-quality CS4398 DAC converts digital signals to analogue, this is then ‘pushed’ to the gold-plated synch outputs by Marantz’s own small signal amplifier, the HDAM-SA2. In addition, also included is a new remote that also controls the PM6005 amp. There is also a new ‘low-power stand-by’ and ‘auto stand-by’ mode to save electricity.

Altogether, the CD6005 is a match made in heaven for the music lover who wants nothing but the best performance at an attractive price.  One more thing: it is also perfect for lovers of portable music, thanks to  its iPod-digital connectivity.

Based on the “Best CD player under £500” by “What Hi-Fi Sound and Vision?”

The CD6005 is also avaialble in other colour options: Silver-Gold, please call to order.

For control of 3 channel constant current LED fittings with selectable outputs of 350, 500, 600 and 700mA.

When used with 3 colour fittings each colour is allocated a channel and can be individually adjusted allowing complete colour mixing. Simple colour cycling is started/stopped using the raise/lower buttons in a Rako wallpanel or hand held remote.

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable  from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RLED36-3DCI</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RLED36-3DCI.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£159.60</g:price><g:mpn>RLED36-3DCI</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Incorporating the latest dimming technology. Hybrid IGBT design enables leading and trailing edge control of lighting loads, quietly and smoothly. The dimmer has four separated dimming channels that can control a total of 2400w/2000va of trailing edge dimmable lighting loads. In parallel with the 4 dimmer channel is a separate switched relay channel for LEDs or Fans or other non dimmed loads. The RAK-4 requires a separate RF receiver (RxLink) which connects using standard CAT5 RJ45 sockets. Controlled from any Rako RAKOM RF device, for example the RCP07 or RCM070 push button RF wallplates.﻿

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable  from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RCM-070</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RCM070_0.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£136.80</g:price><g:mpn>RCM-070</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

This Professional Dimmable 6W GU10 DAZZ-LED has been developed utilising the very best components, providing the very best dimming and used by Professional installers for high end installations using lighting systems such as Lutron, Rako, Light Symphony etc.

The high quality construction consists of LEDs from Samsung 2323 which have been LM80 tested, are high quality, give exceptional light output and have excellent efficiency. To ensure a long life expectancy (30,000 hours), the large heat sink has been completely redesigned to ensure excellent thermal management. These premium features continue with the Premium Dimming IC which provides a very stable and extremely smooth and controllable dimming function (down to 1% dimming) that can work with most dimmer switches (leading or trailing edge - works well with Lutron Homeworks, Aurora AU-DSP400x, Varilight VPro etc).

The LEDs from Samsung and IC dimming circuitry from a European semiconductor manufacturer provide smooth dimming over a wide range. The Professional Dimmable 6W GU10 produces a very bright light with a high Colour Rendering Index. The Professional Dimmable 6W GU10 has a compact design to ensure it fits most fire rated recessed fixtures.

The fully dimmable 6W-GU10 LED is availble in 45 degree and 90 degree versions.

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable  from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RABRIDGE</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RABridge.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£213.60</g:price><g:mpn>RABRIDGE</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

The "PILL" dimmer is useful for installations where fitting a standard Rako dimmer is difficult e.g. retro-fitting to control wall-lights.

The "PILL" dimmer can be controlled from any Rako transmitter such as RCM/RCP wallpanels, RAH hand helds, timeclocks and forms an integral part of a Rako scene-set system. The "PILL" dimmer can also be controlled from a simple momentary action switch giving ON/OFF/Raise/Lower control allowing cost effective extra panels. Control from simple panels still allows the dimmer to be controlled as part of an overall house control system with master Off and macro command response.

These automated projector drops are fully operational via IR Remote Control.

A panel is mounted under the projector, which fills the hole in the ceiling when the projector is up. The unit is installed like a ceiling speaker – cut a hole in the plaster and then a lip around the edge of the mechanism covers the cut line. The mechanism can be adjusted so the projector angles downwards when at the bottom.

The PD1 allows projectors as tall as 190mm to be stored in a ceiling void of only 210mm and then lowered on command. A panel is mounted under the projector, which fills the hole in the ceiling when the projector is up. The unit is installed like a ceiling speaker – cut a hole in the plaster and then a lip around the edge of the mechanism covers the cut line. The mechanism can be adjusted so the projector angles downwards when at the bottom.

The electric drop operation is controlled by a control box that needs to be accessible. An IR sensor is connected to this box by a 1500mm cable. This control box can also be used to operate projector screens using the standard 4 core mains cable, eg Beamax M series.

The system comes with a basic IR remote control. It also has switch control, so that it can be operated by relays, switches, Lutron, etc

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on.

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable  from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RXLINK</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting Accessories</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting Accessories</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RX-LINK.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£212.40</g:price><g:mpn>RX LINK</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The Russound SaphIR IRJ-1-2 package uses a small free standing, low profile IR receiver. The standard Russound SaphIR IRJ-12 is not designed to be used in front of LCD or plasma screens, which 'drown out' the IR signals you are sending, with the emitted IR from the display.

You can avoid this effect by placing the Russound SaphIR 854 Mini Table Top IR receiver on top of the display slightly set back from the screen front (as shown right) or in a different position entirely. If you have a situation where this is not possible and the IR from the LCD or plasma may affect the IR relay system then you will need to use a Russound SaphIR plasma friendly receiver (please call for details) or the Xantech HL85K or the Xantech DL85K kits.</description><g:id>SaphIR IRJ-1-2</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Household Appliances &gt; Home Automation</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Household Appliances &gt; Home Automation</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Russound_saphir_IRJ.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£102.00</g:price><g:mpn>SaphIR IRJ-1-2</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

They are bi-directional for the video signals and so perform two functions. Firstly, they are used to split signals from the external antenna eg FM/DAB from the antenna or UHF from the aerial prior to decoding. Secondly, they can be used for combining decoded ouput from the modulated RF output of a VCR, a digibox or a modulator, prior to becoming the uplink to the distribution amplifier.

The relevance of the various types depends on the application for which you intend to use it. The bandwidth capability needs to be very high (up to 2400MHz) if you are working with satellite signals. In some cases you need to allow a DC electric current from equipment to power devices, eg the satellite LNB device or a remote IR receiver, whilst preventing this current being passed to other equipment, hence some versions have "DC blocking" or uni-directional "power-pass".

All connections require the use of 'F' type fittings on the co-ax cable.</description><g:id>FJU704</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Satellite &amp; Cable TV</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Satellite &amp; Cable TV</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/FJU704.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£11.76</g:price><g:mpn>FJU704</g:mpn><g:brand>Labgear</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The track is extremely useful to enhance your home security features and for the less able bodied.

The motor is discreetly hidden behind the curtain, and can be fitted at either end of the track. The motor is low voltage 24V item using a plug-in power adapter. The track is not supplied with curtain hooks, you can use your own standard hooks.

These versatile units can be used in a number of innovative ways.

They are designed to be installed directly on the IR control window of the controlled equipment. The almost black shell passes infrared (IR) leaving access to the original remote controller while at the same time making the most unobtrusive installation possible.

The mouse emitters are made of a deep purple Lexan for improved infrared pass-through, allowing a greater range of direct control of components from hand-held controllers. The “D” series emitters also now use an improved adhesive that keeps emitters attached to components in even the most harsh conditions.

NB: This is a 'Blink' emitter, which means that it flashes red visible light to confirm the IR has been transmitted.</description><g:id>286D</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/286D_0.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£25.00</g:price><g:mpn>286D</g:mpn><g:brand>Xantech</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The IR Anywhere over IP can be used in one of three ways:


	You can simply use them as a transmitter and receiver pair over a network (LAN or WAN), with one receiving the IR from a remote control handset, encoding it and transmitting it over the network for the second target unit to receive the signal over the LAN, decode it and re-transmit it to the IR device.
	You can configure each of the units to act as a target device accepting signals over the LAN sent by a PC configured to send the encoded IR signal.
	You can use each of the units to operate as a stand alone target receiver, without involving a PC or transmitter, for local IR relay. An example of this would be say where the equipment is located inside a cupboard: the receiver would be on the outside with an IR emitter running to the inside.</description><g:id>KIRA</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Components &gt; Automation Control Components</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Components &gt; Automation Control Components</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/KIRA.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£108.00</g:price><g:mpn>KIRA</g:mpn><g:brand>Keene</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The CAA66 can be daisy-chained, easily expanding up to 36 zones for any size home or budget. It includes extensive infrared command codes and learning capabilities, making remote and keypad control of the system as simple as pressing a button.

For larger spaces where extra volume is required, zones 1 and 2 can be output at line level (fixed or variable) to say a power amplifier, such as the Russound R275HC Power Amp from Sonance giving 100W at 4 Ohms through two pairs of in-ceiling speakers. Volume control in this scenario would still be achieved from the keypad in the usual way, by using the variable line out setting on the CAA66.

Its dedicated CAA-RC remote control is packed with a comprehensive list of IR device codes and learning capability for simple component control. The new Russound CAA66 offers exceptional value, straightforward operation and adjustable playback for multiroom audio made easy.

Additional Optional Keypads can be pruchased to enhance your CA66 Russound Multiroom Controller System see the full CA66L and CA66K systems. </description><g:id>CAA66</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/CAA66-front.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£1,459.00</g:price><g:mpn>CAA66</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Sonance Visual Performance Series speakers combine elegant, modern style with outstanding audio performance. New micro-trim grills have only 5mm of trim, (compared to the standard 25mm of most conventional in-wall speakers) giving these speakers a clean, sleek appearance that seamlessly integrates into any designed space.

The Sonance Visual Performance speaker grills attach via powerful magnets, for simple, quick installation. A one-step paint process saves time compared to traditional flanged speakers.

The Sonance Visual Performance VP61 speakers feature polypropylene cone woofers and silk dome tweeters for high-quality sound. These Visual Performance speakers are medium 'footprint' size - (W x H) (208mm x 310mm) speakers, and are two way designs which suit medium size rooms.

Note that Visual Performance Series VP61 speakers can be retro-fitted into mounting holes for Sonance Original Series Large (Symphony) speakers without modification, making upgrades exceptionally easy.

Each of the Sonance Visual Performance VP61 in-wall speakers has a pre-prepared aperture that accepts an IR receiver tubular style, eg Xantech MicroLink for controlling IR controlled source equipment.</description><g:id>VP61</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Sonance_VP61_large.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£78.00</g:price><g:mpn>VP61</g:mpn><g:brand>Sonance</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

They are bi-directional for the video signals and so perform two functions. Firstly, they are used to split signals from the external antenna eg FM/DAB from the antenna or UHF from the aerial prior to decoding. Secondly, they can be used for combining decoded ouput from the modulated RF output of a VCR, a digibox or a modulator, prior to becoming the uplink to the distribution amplifier.

The relevance of the various types depends on the application for which you intend to use it. The bandwidth capability needs to be very high (up to 2400MHz) if you are working with satellite signals. In some cases you need to allow a DC electric current from equipment to power devices, eg the satellite LNB device or a remote IR receiver, whilst preventing this current being passed to other equipment, hence some versions have "DC blocking" or uni-directional "power-pass".

All connections require the use of 'F' type fittings on the co-ax cable.</description><g:id>FBS904</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/FBS904.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£7.20</g:price><g:mpn>FBS904</g:mpn><g:brand>Labgear</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The G-Rail 6200W is a low voltage electrically operated track that is delivered ready assembled for ease of installation, (motor needs to be attached to the track) and comes complete with Infra-Red remote control as standard. This is a high quality aluminium track that can be factory bent to a minimum radius of 20cm. The motor is exceptionally quiet, and has slow start and slow stop phases to ease the stress on the motor, but which also keeps the noise of the system to a minimum. Start and stop points are simple to set using the IR remote control.

The G-Rail 6200W is available in lengths from 1 metre up to 12 metres, as either straight or curved tracks. The maximum weight of curtain that can be safely pulled is dependent upon the length of the track itself. A 2m bay window track can handle 20kg, a 3m bay window 30kg, up to the maximum of 45 kg for tracks between 5m and 12m.

This smaller and more diminutive SLK-1 is an ideal companion for systems using the "My Russsound" App as the primary point of control on all supported iOS hand held devices.

The SLK-1 uses a five character LCD to display the current source, volume level and system status. Designed for basic zone control, its white backlit, soft-touch buttons allow for easy access to volume, power and source selection as well as a zone specific favorite and simple source transport option - play/pause, previous and next.

For added convenience, you can turn the whole system on or off and the SLK-1 features an IR receiver for control and IR repeating.</description><g:id>SLK-1</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Audio Mixers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Audio Mixers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Russound%20SLK-1.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£240.00</g:price><g:mpn>SLK-1</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Each button is complete with a blue LED indicator and day-night etched buttons. Easy connection to the Rakom CAT5 wired network is by a removable 8 way punch down module that can be installed at first fix stage prior to the push button front control module. This protects the control module from being damaged while building works are being finished.

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used</description><g:id>WCM020</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/wcm-020.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£194.40</g:price><g:mpn>WCM-020</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

AudioQuest MAC3/G video cable
AudioQuest Instant Tool-less Connectors (ITC) make on-site assembly of RCA component video cables and RCA audio cables a simple and easy task using RG6 cable.

Assembly is a 3 step process:


	Strip the cable as you normally would, exposing the center conductor and braided, foiled dielectric
	Pull the braid back evenly over the jacket
	Just Push! Finished!


We offer the ITC-18 system gold plated RCA connectors for 18AWG based co-ax video RG6 cables. To colour code your cables we also offer coloured bands in packs of 20 of each colour. Red, green, blue, yellow and white are available.

Please watch the QuickTime video in this ITC link for a short explanation of the system.

If you do not have a co-ax cable stripper we can supply a one step stripper tool as shown in the video - see compatible products below.</description><g:id>ITC-18RCA</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Itc-18.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£25.88</g:price><g:mpn>ITC-18GRCA</g:mpn><g:brand>Audioquest</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The compact GC-IRL is used with a PC to learn the full spectrum, 30KHz to 500KHz, of IR codes that control infrared driven equipment. When used in conjunction with the free GC-IRL Utility, the learned code is displayed, converted into other formats, and automatically copied into the Windows clipboard.

These learned codes can then be pasted into any Windows application to facilitate quick database and/or spreadsheet creation and updating. The stored codes can be used to control and automate any device that accepts infrared control signals, from any networked computer, and over the Internet. The GC-IRL power is supplied by the RTS line of the serial port and requires no external power supply.</description><g:id>GC-IRL</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/GCIRL_full.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£87.60</g:price><g:mpn>GC-IRL</g:mpn><g:brand>Global Cache</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

This results in high quality, crystal clear sound that is the perfect volume throughout the entire garden.

The SONARRAY SR1 SYSTEM eliminates problematic loud areas that can make conversation difficult while at the same time addressing quiet areas where you can barely hear the music. Due to the nature of the setup all of the speakers face inwards causing all sound to be contained within the property, so your neighbours will love it as well!</description><g:id>SR1</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/SR1%20%28Sonarray%29.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£3,055.20</g:price><g:mpn>SR1</g:mpn><g:brand>Sonance</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

This means if you purchased a Outclass 4TB server, this will have 2 x 4TB drives installed which will mirror each other. Therefore if one drive fails you have the mirrored drive as backup so none of your data will be lost.

Your server is delivered fully configured in formats of your choice to your requirements. The Outclass supplier also provides unlimited telephone and remote support in addition to your dealer support. The standalone server is the perfect choice if you want to listen to music and watch a few movies. Please note, it cannot be upgraded to be used with the NAS.

If you use your server with Apple TV you wil be using it with Apple Home sharing, this will enable you to play back any content from the server to 5 Apple TVs at any one time.

You will need to purchase the AnyDVD HD (forever licence) from http://www.slysoft.com/en/purchase.html

You can play a movie on an Apple TV in one room, have the same movie or a different one independently playing in all the other rooms as well as streaming it at the same time independently to your iPad and iPhone as well as Android devices.

The OutClass Server has the ability to copy and archive CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray Discs automatically embedding ID tagging, metadata and artwork on its RAID configured storage.

If Apple is not your thing then no problem the OutClass server will work with almost any DLNA and UPNP certified player on your network, like Dune HD players (we recommend Dune Base 3D or Dune 303D), Windows Media Centre, smart TVs, and many more.

If you want to use a different player, we recommend the Dune HD Base 3D or the Dune 303D.  In the past many Dune players do not have a very nice GUI or interface but this Dune player works very well, not only does it have a good interface but it will play back the fully uncompressed bit for bit version of the movie.  The Dune player also handles TV series and box sets much better than the Apple TV.

If you need more storage than the standalone server offers then the Outclass-N Server and Synology NAS drive is for you.

The OutClass Server now can rip and store all your music and movies on a NAS (Network Attached Storage) allowing you freedom to expand the storage easily while locating the OutClass Server anywhere in the house. This new version of the original standalone server still has all of the benefits but replaces its internal storage with a NAS drive.

The Synology NAS drive is available with 6TB - 42TB. When purchased with the recommended Synology NAS, Outclass verify the server and NAS work well together and come with a 3 year guarantee.

If you decide to use your own NAS drive you should ensure the drive has a minimum of 2 network ports

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable  from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RMT-500</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Rako%20RMT500%204.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£134.40</g:price><g:mpn>RMT-500</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Full details can be found on our features tab

Contrary to belief, no cable can improve your system.  This is a logical fact and AudioQuest are aware of this, working on the principle of DO NO HARM!

13A Double Switched socket with the added convenience of USB charging. Suitable for charging USB devices such as mobile phones, smartphones, digital cameras and tablets. This device charges at 5V DC 2A ( 2 x 1000mA) meaning each slot charges USB devices at 1A. Apple iPhone charges at 1A, Apple iPod's charge at 1A, Other Smartphones and portable USB devices charge at between 500mA and 1A. This solution is designed for convenience and to free up socket space from unsightly chargers and will charge the majority of portable USB devices. This device will also charge your iPad, Kindle, and other tablet PC's but at a reduced rate to the original charger. NB: Please note using sub standard or non-authorized cables with Apple products may effect units ability to charge efficiently.

The Labgear HD modulator allows you to send HD HDMI Video, direct from your HDMI source, to anywhere in your home using existing aerial cables; saving you the hassle of rewiring. The system consists of a high definition modulator, H.264 HD video and audio from Sky HD boxes, Set Top Boxes, Blu-ray disc players, video game consoles etc. These can be displayed on all freeview HD TVs around your home. The any non freeview HD TV can be easily connected to using a separate freeview decoder.

This means no expensive rewiring of the house or office is necessary. It supports any number of TVs that are connected around your home or office. You can control Sky using any standard ‘tvLink’ (mouse) receiver. For non Sky devices, for example; Virgin Tivo, Blu-Ray, Apple TV, or HDMI devices you can use the ‘tvLink’ in conjunction with the ‘tvLink Plus’.

Unlike many conventional HD distribution solutions, you don’t need to have a dedicated receiver in each location, therefore whether you have 5 TVs or 50, the price is the same.

If you have multiple devices you wish to distribute, you can ‘daisy-chain’ several boxes together and simply select in your TV guide which you wish to view.</description><g:id>LEM-HD1</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Components &gt; Modulators</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Components &gt; Modulators</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/236-1-original.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£708.00</g:price><g:mpn>LEM-HD1</g:mpn><g:brand>Labgear</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Even with the ultra slim line mounting depth of 69mm this speaker provides high quality sound in locations that have limited mounting spaces such as walls, MDU ceilings or locations that have unusual obstructions.

The ultra-lightweight yet powerful neodymium magnets allow for a compact driver design for installation in tight spaces. With its NeoDrive compact driver design the RSF-635 employs an inverted neodymium magnet structure to reduce speaker depth without compromising on sound quality.

The edgeless grille blends discretely into your decor and can be painted to match your decor.  The Triple-dog mounting system enables swift installation, up to 25% quicker than standard 4-dog models.

The Russound XStream X5 is the first of its kind room-by-room distributed audio system. Unlike its hard-wired predecessors, the X5 is a certified WiFi device that wirelessly synchronizes audio across all X5-powered rooms. It’s designed to be subtle, unobtrusive and blend easy into any décor. Removable side panels reveal mounting brackets so you can easily mount and hide the unit behind furniture, TV displays or in a closet. The X5 puts your music up front and keeps the hardware out of the way.

Every room in your home is unique, and the X5 is the only product capable of offering customized options for each room. The back panel of the X5 features a number of wired connections, offering customized options to bring audio into each room of your home. The X5 is a streamer, an amplifier and a room controller all in one box-- and much more. The X5 is the first to be built on an all-digital platform. Digital inputs, digital streaming content, digital amplification at 50w per channel, and a high-end DAC deliver better audio performance. Designed for custom installation professionals, the X5 can change the way you approach distributed audio.

Russound was the first multi-room audio company to embrace Apple Airplay and offer popular on-board streaming services. Stream your audio content to the X5 and listen to it throughout your home. The X5 also supports Bluetooth streaming through an optional external receiver, the BTC-1X. The external Bluetooth option allows you to locate the receiver for maximum reception and performance, unlike most products that can be limited by internal Bluetooth reception capabilities.

Unlike other streaming solutions, the X5 offers real control, better performance and superior content. X5 is the only single room audio streamer, amplifier and controller with a keypad connection that offers full control of each room of audio. Russound has three different keypad options for the X5:


	The TS3 touchscreen
	The MDK-C6 multi-line display keypad
	The SLK-1 single-line display keypad


Additionally, every X5 zone can be controlled by the My Russound App, available for iOS and Android devices. The app and keypad can be configured to control other AV devices connected to X5. Every X5 has an IR database with universal and learning commands to control other AV devices. The X5 can also be controlled by other home automation systems through RIO, our open IP protocol. The power to control your musical universe, right there in your hands.

The XStream X5 offers several benefits for the installer: Wireless connectivity simplifies installation because no centralized wiring is needed in the home. All connections between X5 products are wireless through standard 802.11 WiFi or wired Ethernet connections, making the X5 an excellent solution for retrofit and preexisting homes. And if you’re familiar with current Russound systems, there are no new software programs to learn; our X5 unit uses the same programming tools used with our C-series systems. The X5 also uses the same keypads and app for control as our C-Series system. Everything from remotes, to the speakers, amplifiers and controllers can be hidden in each room, removing the AV clutter. And with the X5, you can personalize the user experience in each room while the operation and control is consistent throughout the system.</description><g:id>RUS-X5</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Accessories</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/X5_Front.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£499.00</g:price><g:mpn>X5</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The Televes HD modulator allows you to send HD HDMI Video, direct from your HDMI source, to anywhere in your home using existing aerial cables; saving you the hassle of rewiring. The system consists of a high definition modulator, H.264 HD video and audio from Sky HD boxes, Set Top Boxes, Blu-ray disc players, video game consoles etc. These can be displayed on all freeview HD TVs around your home. The any non freeview HD TV can be easily connected to using a separate freeview decoder.

This means no expensive rewiring of the house or office is necessary. It supports any number of TVs that are connected around your home or office. You can control Sky using any standard ‘tvLink’ (mouse) receiver. For non Sky devices, for example; Virgin Tivo, Blu-Ray, Apple TV, or HDMI devices you can use the ‘tvLink’ in conjunction with the ‘tvLink Plus’.

Unlike many conventional HD distribution solutions, you don’t need to have a dedicated receiver in each location, therefore whether you have 5 TVs or 50, the price is the same.

If you have multiple devices you wish to distribute, you can ‘daisy-chain’ several boxes together and simply select in your TV guide which you wish to view.</description><g:id>554912</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Televes%20DigiMod%20HD%20%281%29_0.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£936.00</g:price><g:mpn>554912</g:mpn><g:brand>Televes</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The RSA-615's feature a 1" (2.54 cm) Pivoting PEI tweeter, and a polypropylene cone woofer. They can handle power at a nimble 5-80 watts and are rated at 8 ohms and are sold individually (perfect for entry level home cinema purchases). They can be installed with a square grill as well - available separately. They are sold separately - so they are ideal for custom installation in-ceiling home cinema use, so not only do they work reducing 'acoustic waste' in this application, but because they can be bought individually - installers need not be forever buying pairs and breaking these up for cinema installations</description><g:id>RSA-615</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Audio &gt; Audio Components &gt; Speakers</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RSA-615%20Speaker.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£192.00</g:price><g:mpn>RSA-615</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RCM-100</g:id><g:google_product_category>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Home &amp; Garden &gt; Lighting</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RCM100.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£136.80</g:price><g:mpn>RCM-100</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The WAVFR allows up to 10 volt-free contact closures to interface to the network which can then trigger lighting scenes and actions. It is fitted with a 10 way set of screw terminals for signal input and an additional 3 way connector for Common inputs. The WAVFR is configured in Rasoft and signal inputs can trigger lighting scenes or actions in a similar fashion to button presses on a wall panel.

Introduction to Scene Lighting

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

Why have a multiswitch?

 

Distributing your satellite TV, UHF TV, VCR and DVD around your home using the Labgear TV distribution amplifiers is quite straight forward, but if you plan to future proof your home to enable multiple Sky or freesat digi boxes then the Labgear Distribution Amplifiers may no longer be suitable on its own. A single quad LNB on a freesat (or Sky) dish will allow you to have 2 Sky HD boxes, but more than this and you need to use a multiswitch, which is essentially a clever splitter.


How a multiswitch works

The satellite signal feed is made up of one of four components (known as High band V, High band H, Low band V, Low band H). Your Sky or freesat dig box only requires one component at a time and sends a signal to tell the Quad LNB which one of these 4 components it wants. This component request can change according to which channel you are watching. A Quad LNB is powered from your Sky box and responds to this request sending the specific component demanded at any given time.

The Quattro LNB is different from the Quad LNB in that it is a passive device and outputs each one of the four components individually all the time.

Essentially the Labgear multiswitch is a matrix switch taking in these 4 components and making them available upon request at each of the outlets. As with the Quad LNB the multiswitch receives the demand signal from the Sky or freesat box and sends the appropriate component signal to the particular outlet demanding it.


Labgear Multiswitch features

The Labgear multiswitches have five inputs: the fifth input is to allow for the insertion of a terrestrial TV signal. If you also have an FM and DAB aerial, use a three way combiner to add these signals to the terrestrial TV signal before connecting it to the multiswitch.

All Labgear multiswitches have adjustable gain on each input so that you can balance satellite and TV reception.The unit contains an integrated high gain amplifier to compensate for insertion loss and boosts the signal for the best possible sound and picture quality. All the inputs are completely isolated from each other to prevent signal bleed.


NB. Labgear multiswitches do not have Infra-Red pass through to provide a return path for IR signals in a remote room when used with the Labgear Handylink or Global tvLINK IR relay systems. This means that if you require central control of IR equipment you need to combine the multiswitch with a Labgear TV distribution amplifier. This combination is the most common arrangement please call for details on your best arrangement.</description><g:id>LMS512Q</g:id><g:google_product_category>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Satellite &amp; Cable TV</g:google_product_category><g:product_type>Electronics &gt; Video &gt; Satellite &amp; Cable TV</g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/263-1-original_0.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£120.00</g:price><g:mpn>LMS512QQ</g:mpn><g:brand>Labgear</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Russound’s R-Series amps have been extremely popular with installers for many years. Now with the introduction of the D-Series the performance has moved up a level and they come with all the benefits of class D amplification, plus they are lighter and take up less room, making them an even more obvious choice for the installer.

The feature-rich design of the D1650 is ideal for the demands of distributed audio systems and is also compatible with our Russound volume controls. The D1650’s 16 channels are arranged in stereo pairs to provide discreet amplification and custom configurations for each of 8 zones.It is possible to bridge the D1650 to provide 8 mono channels with 160watts. Bridging is independent for each channel, enabling a mixture of 160 watt and 50 watt channels – ideal for Dolby Atmos installations where seven high power channels and two lower powered channels may be required.

Sound Quality

The D-Series amplifiers all have the same legendary Russound sound quality and installer-friendly features customers have come to expect. Ultra-low distortion output (relatively unheard of in other multi-zone amplifiers) allows for clean, undistorted audio even at high listening volumes. A robust protection circuit provides efficient, safe and reliable operation under extreme conditions and protects each amplifier output channel.

Home Theatre

The D-Series amps are even up to the rigorous demands of home theater applications, easily transforming into a powerful 160 watt X 8 channel monster (in bridged mode). You can also choose to individually un-bridge pairs for lower power applications such as Dolby Atmos or surround speakers. As an example you could run a Dolby Atmos 7.1.2 system at 7 channels @ 160W and 2 channels @ 50W. That’s Russound versatility!

Say “no” to the hum

Advanced triggering options allow the amps to operate on demand. Apart from the obvious energy efficiency, there is no amplifier hum on your speakers when the system isn’t in use.

Through redesign the digital amplifiers now feature a lighter weight smaller chassis and more efficient class D Power.The feature-rich design of the D850 is ideal for the demands of distributed audio systems and is also compatible with our Russound volume controls

Russounds D850 amplifier features 8 channels / 4 zones.  This means you can run 4 pairs of stereo speakers into 4 independent rooms or zones each pair producing 100W. All rooms can 4 independent music sources at any time or any zone can be joined to the internal Bus to play the same music in all zones. With Ultra-low distortion output (relatively unheard of in other multi-zone amplifiers) allows for clean, undistorted audio even at high listening volumes. A robust protection circuit provides efficient, safe and reliable operation under extreme conditions and protects each amplifier output channel.

Need more Power?

With Bridgable Channels, the D850 can increase the power output from the amplifier to your speakers. By bridging the channels you will decrease your zone / room availability but increase the power to the speakers working from the bridged channel.The D-Series amps are even up to the rigorous demands of home theatre applications, easily transforming into a powerful 160 watt X 4 channel monster (in bridged mode). You can also choose to individually un-bridge pairs for lower power applications such as Dolby Atmos or surround speakers. As an example you could run a 5.1 system at 3 channels @ 160W and 2 channels at 50W. That’s Russound versatility!



What is Class D

Class D is digital amplification, cool running amplification, light weight smaller chassis,high efficiency (&gt; 90% on average);which is significantly better than a Class-AB design (78.5 percent at best and typically closer to 50 percent).

Lose the "hum"

Advanced triggering options allow the amps to operate on demand. Apart from the obvious energy efficiency, there is no amplifier hum on your speakers when the system isn’t in use.

Whenever a Bluetooth signal is received, the BTA-2 will automatically switch the active audio source to the Bluetooth device, making it simple and easy to use by any home owner.

The advanced Bluetooth radio module with aptX audio encoding offers a higher quality audio signal whenever an aptX-enabled Bluetooth device is utilized as the music source. When the BTA-2 is paired, it will automatically switch the music source from the main system source to the local Bluetooth source. This local connection will remain until pairing is disconnected or the Bluetooth device is out of range for longer than 3 minutes.

The input source should be connected to the Cat.5 or above cable between the A-Bus hub and the A-Bus Keypad using RJ-45 connectors. It can also be wired in series with other local input modules using Cat.5 or above cable. The BTA-2 module closest to the room's A-Bus amplified keypad will be the master.

The BTA-2 may be used with all A-BUS installations. For installations where more than one BTA-2 is desired, a Windows software application is available free of charge to allow for custom naming of each BTA-2 as well as to allow for the use of a customized password for security purposes</description><g:id>BTA-2</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/BTA-2.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£142.00</g:price><g:mpn>BTA-2</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The controller also has a system clock with an alarm and sleep timer, home cinema triggers, routed and common IR outputs, and zone specific 12VDC trigger outputs.

The latest generation of C Series controller/amplifiers have fantastic new features all detailed below.

More Power, the upgrade C Series offer more power resulting in a more powerful , responsive processor than its predecessor. As a result of the enhanced power, the controller can communicate twice as fast with other network devices like the DMS-3.1 or the My Russound App, delivering an exceptionally satisfying experience for the user.

Bluetooth,;now with the additional of of a dedicated Bluetooth receiver module embedded in the controller unit you can remotely situate a Russound BTC-1x receiver module in a suitable zone(up to 280ft/85m maximum distance)and this can be shared with the rest of the system, or utilised as a dedicated 'local' source input for that zone alone. This means that simple cost effective streaming from mobile devices (Android or iOS) can be simply introduced and used pretty much out of the box - and without a big outlay.

IR Learning facility,this is the most exciting upgrade for the MCA-66i, the addition of several dedicated digital inputs. The MCA-66i already has the capability to learn in IR codes for any non-Russound source components. But with the addition of the digital inputs alongside the analogue inputs there is the flexibility of integrating products ike Apple TV's or Satellite boxes that only have dedicated digital outputs. This is also perfect for ensuring the minimum of lip-sync issues if you are synchronizing HD video switching alongside your Russound audio system with a Myro:Bridge for instance.  

Russound MRA-3 'My Russound' App is now available. This is specifically for C Series products and X5 Multi-Room systems. The App is fully intuitive and very easy to control via iOS and Android devices, no need to leave your chair, once you are connected you are in full control with your smart device. The "My Russound" App offers seamless control of both their C-Series Controller's and the new X5 streamer/controller/amplifier and is free of charge, so once you have downloaded the from the iTunes store or the Google Play Store you're ready to go.

When the App is used in conjunction with the DMS-3.1 and an MCA or X5 controller as a stand alone system cover art, full media meta-data and content browsing is enabled and displayed. This means that internet radio, music from USB devices/drives &amp; music on indigenous computers on a LAN can all be accessed seamlessly, and controlled via the 'My Russound' App on your Android or iOS device. In addition to this if you have an IR learning device any IR driven third party device such as your TV, Satellite/Sky box or Blu-ray players programmed into your C-series or X5 system, can also be seamlessly controlled. Unlike other systems out there - you don't need anything else. No extra boxes...just a reliable network infrastructure and you are up and running with full control from the MRA-3 App for Apple iOS devices or Android smart phones or tablets.

Installation,for installers; the MCA-66i has both a front USB and Ethernet port for programming ease. The controller can be configured via free programming software, and also boasts an easy to use front IR learning centre for use in programming with all IR driven source devices. In addition, the MCA-66i has RS-232 and also more importantly an Ethernet port allowing for seamless integration with 3rd party control/home automation systems, with Russound's network based control protocol called 'RIO'.This feature has been generously enhanced by Russound as the MCA-66i forms part of the new Russound C-Series generation it can now be seamlessly integrated into KNX systems with the new KNX-RIO-1 gateway.

Please Note: The MCA-66i is part of the Russound Certified Installer Required Program and can only be installed and configured by a Russound Certified Installer. This is why we cannot offer click to buy.But please call for competitive pricing and installation details.</description><g:id>MCA-66i</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/MCA-66i%20Front%20and%20Rear.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£2,006.00</g:price><g:mpn>1550-536410</g:mpn><g:brand>Russound</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

The MCA-88i also has source loop outputs - which makes stacking controllers a breeze for larger more expansive systems. The controller also has a system clock with an alarm and sleep timer, home cinema triggers, routed and common IR outputs, and zone specific 12VDC trigger outputs.;A range of control options with a myriad of keypads enables true flexibility for many projects as the MDK-C6 and SLK-1 Keypads or TS3 touchscreens are all supported.

The more expansive nature of the MCA-88i sees that all zones are equipped with fixed or variable line-level outputs, ideal for outboard amplification (such as Russound D250LS Amplifier) or integration sub-systems or into sub-zone use (Like the A-SZ4 A-Bus Module for C-Series).  Russound's RNET link also allows for meta-data transmission and control of Russound RNET Smart Source components, including the iBridge Dock and also HD Video Matrix integration (Myro:Bridge). The MCA-88i has lost it's internal AM/FM RDS tuner, but with the advent of more internet based streaming services (including Radio) it seems a logical step, but for those desperate to have 'old school' radio - then the MCA-88i is fully compatible with the Russound ST-1e.

The StreamAmp is fitted with an optical SPDIF input which can be connected to a flat screen TV or CD player, two analogue and one USB inputs. The latter enables access to music files on memory sticks or HDDs. Instant Bluetooth Aptx connection is possible with NFC enabled smartphones and tablets.

The StreamAmp is fitted with four loudspeaker outputs and a power optimisation impedance switch. The four speaker outputs allow you to choose from one or two pairs with stereo distribution or, mono distribution with two or four groups of speakers. Designed for use in a professional system, the amp can for example amplify up to eight Cabasse's Archipel In-Ceiling speakers and of course can be controlled by Wi-Fi from any room in the house.

This attention to detail and 'real world' adaptability means it really is suited and optimised to the best custom installation scenario's. Plus, the Stream Amp provides 4 types of room adaptation for Cabasse speakers. Using the app simply select which speakers are used where they are positioned in the room. The improvement, which is stunning with compact speakers thanks to the obvious low-end extension benefits, is also obvious with floor-standing speakers, with more air and definition across the entire bandwidth.

The Stream Amp utilises a very good quality and highly musical amplifier, that delivers deceptively subtle and detailed audio performance with its 2 x 50w amplifier. Most importantly though - the amplifier has been engagingly designed to work beautifully with the entire Cabasse range (all Cabasse's speakers are conceived using the same fundamental principles, using their highly acclaimed coaxial design approach - meaning that any speaker is voiced in harmony with any other from the range), so it can be paired with any satellite, floor-stander or in-wall/in-ceiling speaker. If more low end in any zone is required - of course the Stream Amp can be suitably paired with Cabasse's Santorin sub-woofer range as it has a dedicated sub out amongst the output stage.

This means that you can choose from the entire range, or mix and match and still maintain the best audio playback, and you will know that this performance is one that been optimised to enjoy the best audio reproduction of one of Europe's most innovative and respected speaker manufacturers.

The Stream Amp as you would expect benefits not only from Cabasse's signature sound - it also benefits from that French panache and design flair that others imitate, but rarely pull off. Compact streaming audio just got seriously serious!</description><g:id>STREAM-AMP</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/Cabasse%20Stream%20Amp.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£549.00</g:price><g:mpn>STREAM-AMP</g:mpn><g:brand>Cabasse</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

Taking only 1U in a 19" racking unit, the Blustream HMKL44-Kit 4x4 Matrix Kit ticks all of the boxes for a space efficient, cost effective solution for the distribution of HDMI from four source devices, for example Sky Boxes, Blu-ray Players, Gaming Systems, Apple TVs and many more to four, TV- Display units. Allowing any device to access any source independently.

The matrix features Bi-Directional IR control and PoH, therefore no additional power supplies are required at the receiver, as the power can be passed along the Cat cable for up to 70 metres (1080p, 4K = 40 metres). On the back of the unit there are  Zone specific bidirectional RS232 ports for nonnection to PC or control processer to control RS232 devices in the rooms via the HDbaseT room receivers RS232 port as well as an RS232 port – For control of the matrix switcher from PC or control processer.

The matrix can be controlled via the buttons on the front of the unit, via an iPad or other smart device or by the simple and easy to use remote. With easy Input and Output selection of 1-4 zones. For example:To switch source 2 to zone 4 you would press 4 in the output section (A) followed by pressing 2 in the Input section (B). ALL button: The all button selects all the inputs or outputs in its corresponding box. Example: (The “All” button in the Output box selects all the zones so all zones will change to what source input is selected next) pTp: This button will align all the zone outputs with the like numbered source inputs. Example: Input 1 to output 1, input 2 to output 2, etc.

On the front of the matrix unit is a neat LCD display window. from here you can identify the three EDID segments,ensuring all of your source devices are correctly identified. EDID (Extended Display Identification Data) is a data structure that is used between a display and a source. This data is used by the source to find out what audio and video resolutions are supported by the display then from this information the source will determine what the best resolution is to output. While the objective of EDID is to make connecting a digital display to a source a simple plug and play procedure issues do arise when multiple displays or video matrix switching is introduced because of the increased number of variables. By pre-determining the video resolution and audio format of the source and display device we can remove the need for EDID hand shaking thus making switching quicker and more reliable.

The slimline receivers can be discreetly installed behind the TV, at only 26mm deep there no problems with bulkyreceiver boxes to hide. Once installed set up could not be easier, just download the software to your PC from the Drivers &amp; Protocols file then simply commence the recognition process. </description><g:id>HMXL44-KIT</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/BluSteam%20HMXL44-KIT-%20%282%29.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£1,849.99</g:price><g:mpn>HMXL44-KIT</g:mpn><g:brand>Blustream</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

For many homes, lighting has been controlled in the same way for over 85 years, with only the fittings and bulbs themselves changing. With the increasing demand for better quality and more energy efficient lighting; scene lighting has become more and more popular.

Instead of walking into a room and manually setting each light to a correct brightness, which can in many cases be 3 or more different dimmers, Rako allows you to press a single button and instantly have your room ready for watching TV, entertaining, or just reading a book. Every time you enter a room you can go to a desired pre-set scene.

How about a single button by the front door that turns every light in the house off? Or a second that turns on a welcome home scene based on the times of day or even month of the year?

Energy efficiency

With PIR occupancy switches that gently fade down after a room is left; simple dimming based on usage you can drastically reduce your energy usage and of course save money too.

With most home lighting now based on LED it is important that you can control the brightness to once again achieve the correct mood for a room. Rako have dimmers that are compatible with most forms of lighting as well as full colour changing.

Security and Safety

When you are away for extended time you can ensure that your home looks occupied by mimicking your daily lighting habits in selected rooms.

Rako can also be connected to your fire alarms ensuring in the unfortunate event that they are needed, your home can give you correct levels of lighting allowing you to be able to navigate safely out.

Design, Installation, and Programming

Due to the modular and custom concept of Rako we would advise you to speak to us with your ideas and we will be happy to calculate your requirements ensuring everything is suited to your needs.

We will be happy to supply you with diagrams, lighting schedules and guide your electrician through the physical installation of your Rako system.

We can supply all your modules pre-programmed ensuring that you just need to turn it on. This is easily adjustable  from smart phones and tablets so you can evolve with the way your home is used.</description><g:id>RDS-800</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/RDS800C_0.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£78.72</g:price><g:mpn>RDS-800</g:mpn><g:brand>Rako</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>

If you are inputting SD from a CVBS source the encoder still uses MPEG-4 to encode and output an “HD” DVB-T signal which may not show on an “HD Ready” screen.

Automatic HDCP and EDID management continuously negotiates and authenticates communication between connected devices, ensuring simultaneous distribution of source content to all outputs, while also maintaining signal integrity via internal equalization and amplification to output devices.

Systems can be further expanded by cascading multiple EXP-SP-0102-4K units to create larger distributions; with 4K transmissions cascaded twice and 1080p signals up to 12 times to the same model units for flexible, scalable solutions for residential and commercial applications.

Furthermore, with the addition of an in-line WyreStorm EXP-SCL-DAC-4K scaler/Dolby downmixer between splitter and display device, combined 4K, HD and multichannel or stereo audio distributions can be created without risking resolution or audio disparity between devices.

As such, the EXP-SP-0102-4K represents an ideal solution wherever simple-yet-reliable distribution of single HDMI source to multiple outputs is required, with the versatility and cost-efficiency to ensure systems are just as easily expanded or adjusted to meet the needs of any application.</description><g:id>EXP-SP-0102-4K</g:id><g:google_product_category></g:google_product_category><g:product_type></g:product_type><g:image_link>https://www.cyberselect.co.uk/sites/default/files/cart-images/WyreStorm%20HDMI%20Splitter%20-%20WYR-EXP-SP-0102-4K%20%281%29.jpg</g:image_link><g:price>£70.00</g:price><g:mpn>EXP-SP-0102-4K</g:mpn><g:brand>Wyrestorm</g:brand> <g:condition>new</g:condition>
