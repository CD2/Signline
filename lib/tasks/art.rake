Fine Quality Scraperboard is heavily coated with china clay, giving a smooth surface which is then overprinted with black ink. A sharp scraper tool engraves a line through the surface ink to expose the white beneath. It offers an artistic medium which is clear and precise. Used by illustrators and professional artists around the world, its super-smooth surface lets you to work in extremely fine detail. It can also be used as an ideal airbrush medium. Engraving is as easy as drawing with a pencil, and with much the same action. The board provides an extreme level of contrast not possible with other media. Scraperboard can be subsequently coloured and reworked to provide many interesting possibilities. Commercial artists value it for the sparkle it can give to the most mundane subjects, it guarantees perfect reproduction on the poorest of papers.",

The natural instinct is to drive a cutting gouge towards the restraining hand holding the work piece, so we have created a guard that covers the smallest to the more dexterous larger hand, in one item. The guard is held either at the corner of the relief block or on top of the carving material close to the area to be cut. Any slippage is caught in the upright walls of the guard protecting the user from harm. An ergonomic, left or right handed, one piece moulding at a price that makes its inclusion in your tool box and school room a must.",

Engraving is as easy as drawing with a pencil, and with much the same action. The board provides an extreme level of contrast not possible with other media. Scraperboard can be subsequently coloured and reworked to provide many interesting possibilities. Commercial artists value it for the sparkle it can give to the most mundane subjects, it guarantees perfect reproduction on the poorest of papers.",

Engraving is as easy as drawing with a pencil, and with much the same action. The board provides an extreme level of contrast not possible with other media. Scraperboard can be subsequently coloured and reworked to provide many interesting possibilities. Commercial artists value it for the sparkle it can give to the most mundane subjects, it guarantees perfect reproduction on the poorest of papers.",
