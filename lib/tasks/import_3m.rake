    "Description": "Are you sitting comfortably? When you spend time sitting at a desk, it is important to arrange your workspace properly, for comfort and prevention of pain. Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is often caused by a work station that has been set up incorrectly or by the use of inferior equipment. The constant clicking of a \"traditional\" mouse can contribute to RSI and carpal tunnel syndrome. <br/><br/>You can help prevent RSI and enhance your productivity with ergonomic workspace solutions from 3M. The 3M Ergonomic Mouse has been clinically proven to reduce muscle strain and discomfort associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive stress injuries, when compared to using a traditional mouse.<br/><br/> Its unique, ergonomic design helps to align the arm and shoulder in a more relaxed, neutral position, thereby enhancing user comfort and reducing pressure on the delicate median nerve. In this way, it can help to prevent the onset of RSI; those already suffering from aches and pains in the wrist or hand when using a conventional mouse may see an improvement in symptoms by switching to this product. <br/><br/>The 3M Ergonomic Mouse has an optical sensor for smoother, more accurate mouse use, and its surfaces are soft-touch painted for added comfort. To use, grip the handle, rest your hand on the base and use your thumb to left and right click or scroll*. Move the entire unit across your mouse mat, rather than using a 'joystick' motion.<br/><br/> Whilst this new shape and movement may take some time to get used to, most users feel comfortable and start to experience benefits within a few days. Please note that this mouse is for right-handed use only. It is suitable for those with a palm width of 8.9cm or more; a smaller size is also available. Now you're sitting comfortably, you can begin! <br/><br/>System Requirements: Microsoft - XP, Vista and later; Apple - MAC OS 10 X v10.4.X, v10.5X and later; Linux distributions. *Scrolling function does not work with MAC operating systems.<br/><br/><img src=\"https://www.3mdirect.co.uk/media/wysiwyg/3mdirect_images/other-images/ergo_mouse_wrist_position_graphic3.jpg\" alt=\"Ergonomic Mouse Wrist Position\" />",

ScotchBlue Painterâ€™s Tape is different. Easy to peel off the roll without shredding, it sticks smoothly and securely but removes cleanly â€“ even after 14 days â€“ to leave you with nothing but sharp paint lines and a professional-looking result. Suitable for use on a variety of surfaces, including painted walls and woodwork, glass and metal, it is resistant to UV and wonâ€™t degrade in direct sunlight. This makes it easy to remove from more challenging areas like window frames without damaging the underlying surface. <br> <br>Whether youâ€™re a professional decorator or a DIY perfectionist, ScotchBlue Painters Tape is an essential addition to your kit. This pack contains 1 roll of tape measuring 38 mm wide by 55 m long. Please note that surfaces should be properly bonded before applying ScotchBlue Painters Tape.<br> <br>For an even more advanced masking tape try ScotchBlue Edge-Lock Advanced Tapes with Edge-Lock Paint Line Protector. This proprietary 3M adhesive technology repels paint away from the edge of the tape to prevent it seeping or bleeding through â€“ an excellent choice when working with strong colours or creating decorative features.",

    "Description": "When you have sanding and prep work to do, 3M offers a wide range of high performance sandpapers, flexible abrasives, sanding sponges and tools. Select the best sanding tool for the task and you will have less work on your hands, with supreme results. SandBlaster Sandpaper is coated with mineral and features an advanced, durable backing material that resists tearing, for a satisfying day's work. <br/><br/>SandBlaster Sandpaper Fine Grit is perfect for use between coats of paint or varnish on a wide range of surfaces including emulsion, wood, metal, plastic and fibreglass. This evenly coated sandpaper resists clogging and tearing  -  when dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! These sheets of sandpaper can be used by hand, or with sanding blocks or machine sanders. When compared to conventional alternatives of comparable grits, SandBlaster Sandpaper cuts up to three times faster, stays sharp and delivers a smoother, long-lasting finish. <br/><br/>This pack contains 3 sheets of SandBlaster Sandpaper P240 Fine Grit, each of which measures 230 mm x 280 mm. Choose this grade for a smoother, finer finish. Designed for sanding flat areas such as table tops or walls, the sheets are ideal for hand sanding or can be easily cut into smaller pieces for use with an electrical sander. To make hand sanding easier, why not try the 3M Rubber Sanding Block? Simply attach a piece of SandBlaster Sandpaper to the heavyweight block for an improved grip, extra power and better sanding control. <br/><br/>Material: Aluminium Oxide. It is recommended that a suitable respirator and safety goggles/glasses are worn during sanding. Sanding lead based paints can be hazardous. <br/><br/>SandBlaster Sandpaper: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.",

ScotchBlue Painterâ€™s Tape is different.

Suitable for use on a variety of surfaces, including painted walls and woodwork, glass and metal, it is resistant to UV and wonâ€™t degrade in direct sunlight. This makes it easy to remove from more challenging areas like window frames without damaging the underlying surface. <br> <br>Whether youâ€™re a professional decorator or a DIY perfectionist, ScotchBlue Painters Tape is an essential addition to your kit. This pack contains 1 roll of tape measuring 25 mm wide by 55 m long. Please note that surfaces should be properly bonded before applying ScotchBlue Painters Tape.<br> <br>For an even more advanced masking tape try ScotchBlue Edge-Lock Advanced Tapes with Edge-Lock Paint Line Protector. This proprietary 3M adhesive technology repels paint away from the edge of the tape to prevent it seeping or bleeding through â€“ an excellent choice when working with strong colours or creating decorative features.",

The 3M LX550 Laptop Computer Stand raises your laptop to a height and distance that encourages an ergonomically correct posture  -  helping to prevent eyestrain as well as the aches and pains that can result from long periods at your desk.<br/><br/> With its professional, practical design, you can adjust the height by up to 75 mm, until you have the perfect level for a comfortable posture. Once adjusted, you have the option of attaching an auxiliary keyboard and mouse to your laptop, so that your laptop can be viewed and used like a monitor  -  a versatile alternative to a traditional desktop computer.<br/><br/> This non-slip Laptop Computer Stand is also compatible for use with most docking stations, for quick and easy connectivity, and incorporates cable management to keep cords and cables organized. This Laptop Computer Stand is 21.5 centimetres wide by 24.5 centimetres deep, with a height of 24.1 centimetres.

To reduce aches and tension in the neck, back and shoulders, your head should be centred over your torso and upright  -  not bent or turned. Now you're sitting comfortably, you can begin!",

    "Description": "During the first four months of a child's life the visual pathways develop as the eye matures and receives images which are then sent to the brain. For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time. However, if anything interferes with this development, it can result in amblyopia and reduced vision. Amblyopia is a condition that only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years in order to be corrected. <br/><br/>The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child's stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop. The length of time and the number of hours per day that your child is required to wear the patch varies, so it is important to follow the specific treatment routine that is prescribed. <br/><br/>Opticlude Orthoptic Eye Patches are tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe to provide a comfortable solution to childhood amblyopia. <br/><br/>This pack contains 20 oval Junior-size patches, measuring 6.3cm x 4.7cm, with rub-off transfer pictures so your child can have fun! They have a central pad which absorbs excess moisture and are made from a breathable, hypoallergenic and latex-free material. <br/><br/>Easy to apply and remove, now you can make patching a pleasure. <br/><br/>N.B.: Occlusion therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of an orthoptist or other suitably qualified healthcare professional<br/><br/><strong>This product should only be used as advised by an ophthalmologist.</strong>",

The height of the platform can also be altered if required, depending on how you would like to position your legs. It can help to reduce strain and fatigue on the legs, back and neck by helping you achieve an ergonomically correct posture whilst sitting at your desk. <br/><br/>The 3M FR430CB Foot Rest has a wide plastic platform with a slip-resistant 3M Safety Walk Material surface, which provides comforting and secure traction for your feet  -  even if you work in bare feet or socks! The sturdy, heavy duty steel base keeps it securely in place under your desk, even when placed on carpet. There is no self-assembly required  -  set up is as easy as opening the box, positioning it under your desk and using your feet to set it to the perfect angle.

    "Description": "Fluff, pet-hair and dust are part of everyday life, but they can make your clothes, furniture or car look dirty or unkempt. Scotch-Brite lint rollers have been developed with sticky technology to quickly lift lint, fluff, pet-hair, dust and other dry residue from car seats, upholstery and even your clothes without damaging fabric. <br/><br/>Hold the lint roller by the ergonomically-designed handle and pass the roll across the fabric you wish to clean. When the top-sheet is covered with fluff and appears to have reduced stickiness, tear it off at the perforation to reveal a new sticky sheet beneath. Save the label to wrap around the outside of your lint roller and you'll stop it from sticking to everything else in your drawer or picking up dirt when you're not using it. A must-have for pet owners, they are also great to keep handy in the car, in your desk or by the front door for a quick spruce up of your clothing before you leave. Keep a few in strategic places around the house  -  for example where pets like to sleep, or in your wardrobe or cloakroom for a quick touch-up of coats or bags. <br/><br/>This item is a lint roller with a comfortably-designed handle and 30 perforated sticky sheets. It offers superior adhesion and is quick and easy to use  -  this is how we roll!",

    "Description": "During the first four months of a child's life the visual pathways develop as the eye matures and receives images which are then sent to the brain. For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time. However, if anything interferes with this development, it can result in amblyopia and reduced vision. Amblyopia is a condition that only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years in order to be corrected. <br/><br/>The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child's stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop. The length of time and the number of hours per day that your child is required to wear the patch varies, so it is important to follow the specific treatment routine that is prescribed. <br/><br/>Opticlude Boys & Girls Eye Patches are tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe to provide a comfortable solution to childhood amblyopia. Our Eye Patches are specially designed for children, featuring different sizes, pictures and colours to brighten up their day - and yours! <br/><br/>This pack contains 30 oval maxi Patches, measuring 5.7cm x 8cm, in 3 different colourful patterns. They have a central pad which absorbs excess moisture and are made from a breathable, hypoallergenic and latex-free material. <br/><br/>Easy to apply and remove, now you can make patching a pleasure. <br/><br/>N.B.: Occlusion therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of an orthoptist or other suitably qualified healthcare professional.<br/><br/><strong>This product should only be used as advised by an ophthalmologist.</strong>",

ScotchBlue Painterâ€™s Tape is different. Easy to peel off the roll without shredding, it sticks smoothly and securely but removes cleanly â€“ even after 14 days â€“ to leave you with nothing but sharp paint lines and a professional-looking result. Suitable for use on a variety of surfaces, including painted walls and woodwork, glass and metal, it is resistant to UV and wonâ€™t degrade in direct sunlight. This makes it easy to remove from more challenging areas like window frames without damaging the underlying surface. <br/> <br/>Whether youâ€™re a professional decorator or a DIY perfectionist, ScotchBlue Painters Tape is an essential addition to your kit. This pack contains 1 roll of tape measuring 50 mm wide by 55 m long. Please note that surfaces should be properly bonded before applying ScotchBlue Painters Tape.<br/> <br/>For an even more advanced masking tape try ScotchBlue Edge-Lock Advanced Tapes with Edge-Lock Paint Line Protector. This proprietary 3M adhesive technology repels paint away from the edge of the tape to prevent it seeping or bleeding through â€“ an excellent choice when working with strong colours or creating decorative features.",

Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is often caused by a work station that has been set up incorrectly or by inferior equipment.

You can help prevent RSI and enhance your productivity with the use of ergonomic solutions from 3M. <br><br>The 3M Extra Wide Adjustable Laptop, Monitor or Printer Stand raises your screen to a height and distance that encourages an ergonomically correct posture  -  helping to prevent eyestrain as well as the aches and pains that can result from long periods at your desk. With its contemporary, professional design, this monitor stand has stacking, non-slip columns that enable users to raise their monitor, laptop, TV or printer from 2.5 centimetres to 15 centimetres above the desk surface in 4.75 centimetre increments. Once raised, there is enough clearance underneath to store files, items of stationery or external drives, helping to keep your work surface organised and clutter-free. The stand measures 50 centimetres by 31 centimetres, with a clear depth underneath the stand of 12 centimetres. It can support monitors or screens weighing up to 18kg. <br><br>For optimum personal comfort and to avoid eyestrain, use this Monitor Stand to position your screen directly in front of your eyes, at or below eye level, at a comfortable viewing distance of 50-75 centimetres. To reduce aches and tension in the neck, back and shoulders, your head should be centred over your torso and upright  -  not bent or turned. Now you're sitting comfortably, you can begin!",

Remove the swab, the results are visual and easy to interpret: a) If it's green there are no proteins that may be allergenic in nature detected. b) If it turns grey or purple it indicates that contamination remains on the surface and so may represent an allergenic cross contamination risk.

Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream provides long-lasting moisturisation for fragile skin, and forms a barrier on the skin to protect it from other bodily fluids.<br/><br/> The formula is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way  -  just a pea-sized amount should be sparingly applied to dry skin. You'll know if you have used too much, as your skin will feel oily. The cream is very long-lasting and is wash-resistant, so you do not have to reapply after every wash. What's more, you can apply adhesive dressings, tape or pads, and the cream will not prevent them from sticking, nor will it clog or cause the dressing material to break down. In some cases, the cream may actually increase the adhesion properties of a dressing or a pad, so apply with caution if your skin is very fragile.<br/><br/> Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream should not be used on infected areas of skin  -  for example, fungal infections. Please seek medical advice and the approval of your doctor before you begin using the cream.",

    "Description": "Are you sitting comfortably? When you spend time sitting at a desk, it is important to arrange your workspace properly, for comfort and prevention of pain. Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is often caused by a work station that has been set up incorrectly or by the use of inferior equipment. The constant clicking of a traditional\" mouse can contribute to RSI and carpal tunnel syndrome. You can help prevent RSI and enhance your productivity with ergonomic workspace solutions from 3M. <br><br>The 3M Wireless Ergonomic Mouse has been clinically proven to reduce muscle strain and discomfort associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive stress injuries, when compared to using a traditional mouse. Its unique, ergonomic design helps to align the arm and shoulder in a more relaxed, neutral position, thereby enhancing user comfort and reducing pressure on the delicate median nerve. In this way, it can help to prevent the onset of RSI; those already suffering from aches and pains in the wrist or hand when using a conventional mouse may see an improvement in symptoms by switching to this product. <br><br>The 3M Wireless Ergonomic Mouse has an optical sensor for smoother, more accurate mouse, and its surfaces are soft-touch painted for added comfort. To use, grip the handle, rest your hand on the base and use your thumb to left and right click or scroll*. Move the entire unit across your mouse mat, rather than using a 'joystick' motion. Whilst this new shape and movement may take some time to get used to, most users feel comfortable and start to experience benefits within a few days. Please note that this mouse is for right-handed use only. It is suitable for those with a palm width of 8.8cm or less; a larger size is also available. Now you're sitting comfortably, you can begin! <br><br>System Requirements: Microsoft - XP, Vista and later; Apple - MAC OS 10 X v10.4.X, v10.5X and later; Linux distributions. *Scrolling function does not work with MAC operating systems.<br><br><img src=\"https://www.3mdirect.co.uk/media/wysiwyg/3mdirect_images/other-images/ergo_mouse_wrist_position_graphic3.jpg\" alt=\"\" />",

The Nexcare ColdHot Back & Abdomen Gel Pack Belt is a drug-free remedy which provides targeted soothing, for comfort where you need it the most.<br/><br/> Our unique ColdHot Technology provides a versatile solution for either a cooling or a warming sensation. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or freezer, or warmed up in the microwave or by placing in hot water. Choose cold therapy to treat acute injuries and relieve the pain of musculoskeletal injury (the cold will help to reduce the swelling, inflammation and pain); or heat to ease pain and reduce muscle spasm associated with chronic back pain, period pain and rheumatoid arthritis.<br/><br/> Nexcare ColdHot Gel Compresses are hand washable and reusable. This pack includes a simple-to-use, adjustable belt that holds the compress in place against the back or abdomen and gives light support. Simply cool or warm up your compress as per the instructions in the box, slip it into the pocket of the belt and secure the belt firmly in place. The belt is composed of several layers of soft, strong fabric, including 3M patented Thinsulate Insulation Material. This helps keep the compress at a constant temperature for longer, giving you prolonged periods of pain relief before you need to re-cool or reheat it. Please note that cold therapy should be applied for a maximum of 20 minutes, before removing the compress for another 20 minutes and then reapplying. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.<br/><br/><strong>Please consult your doctor if pain persists or worsens.</strong>",

These Picture Clips offer a quick and easy way to tidy up those essential bits and pieces without having to file them away out of sight. <br><br>Use the high-performance Command Strips supplied to position the clips around your kitchen, desk or workspace. You wonâ€™t need a hammer, nails, screws, or glue: the self-adhesive strips will hold strongly to most flat, clean surfaces (including wood, metal, tiles and painted walls) and keep your clips in place for as long as you need. Each clip can hold a few sheets of paper, a postcard or a photo â€“ without the need for magnets, tape, drawing pins or sticky tack. Place a couple near your calendar or wall planner to store party invitations, timetables and appointment cards; or above your desk for those important to-do lists and reminders. The clips are translucent and almost invisible when in use, making them ideal for displaying unframed photos; or for creating an impromptu gallery of childrenâ€™s artwork! They can even be used on the fridge door instead of magnets. <br><br>When you want to remove or reposition your clips, you donâ€™t have to worry about them leaving cracks, holes, damaged plaster, sticky residue or stains â€“ so theyâ€™re perfect for rented accommodation, the office or the classroom. Simply hold the clip gently and pull the tab straight down, stretching it until the strip releases from the wall (we recommend that you follow the instructions on the pack carefully for this). Want to use your clip again? Just reattach it using replacement small Command Adhesive Strips â€“ each pack contains spares, and refill packs are available.<br><br>Command Adhesive Strips offer a quick and easy way to organise your space without damaging your walls. They can be secured to almost any flat, clean surface including wood, tile and paint, but arenâ€™t suitable for use on wallpapered surfaces or for hanging antiques or valuable items.",

It also features 3Mâ€™s SQC cartridge attachment.<br/><br/>The SGP1175 Anti-scale Filterâ€™s proportional bypass provides consistent hardness reduction for repeatable water quality and scale prevention, while also ensuring that all water passes through 3Mâ€™s carbon-block post filter for chlorine and odour removal. This unit is fitted in the SGP1175BN-E fixed-bypass variant of the new high-capacity filter. An additional variant, the SGP1175-E, is a non-bypass version providing a cost-effective alternative capable of protecting the heating elements of equipment such as steamers. Preventing scale build-up in coffee vending machines and steamers helps maintain optimum efficiency, enhancing business performance by minimising energy consumption and the costs of machine downtime and service calls.",

    "Description": "During the first four months of a child's life the visual pathways develop as the eye matures and receives images which are then sent to the brain. For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time. However, if anything interferes with this development, it can result in amblyopia and reduced vision. Amblyopia is a condition only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years of childhood in order to be corrected. <br/><br/>The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child's stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop. The length of time and the number of hours per day that your child is required to wear the patch varies, so it is important to follow the specific treatment routine that is prescribed. <br/><br/>Opticlude Boys & Girls Eye Patches are tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe to provide a comfortable solution to childhood amblyopia. Our Eye Patches are specially designed for children, featuring different sizes, pictures and colours to brighten up their day - and yours! <br/><br/>This pack contains 50 oval mini patches, measuring 5.0cm x 6.0cm, in 3 different colourful patterns and designed in a new, comfortable fish tail shape. They have a central, absorbent pad which absorbs excess moisture, and are made from a breathable, hypoallergenic and latex-free material. <br/><br/>Easy to apply and remove, now you can make patching a pleasure. <br/><br/>N.B.: Occlusion therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of an orthoptist or other suitably qualified healthcare professional.<br/><br/><strong>This product should only be used as advised by an ophthalmologist.</strong>",

And a 14-percent increase in clarity means it blocks onlookers' view without diminishing yours. So you can enjoy peace of mind in close quarters or high traffic areas while showing off your style. Plus, easy-on, easy-off 3M GOLD Privacy Filters are the convenient way to create a fashionable barrier while protecting your fragile LCD screen. And because they don't rely on blurring or distorting images to guard your privacy, they go a long way in protecting your eyes. Simply size up your screen and scroll the model list. Then boldly take your digital life with you, wherever life takes you. Even better, all 3M GOLD Privacy Filters are backed by a one-year warranty. <br/><br/> Measure Twice. Order Once. <br/><br/> Even if you have a pretty good idea what screen size and aspect ratio your laptop boasts, it's best to pull out the ruler. By ordering the 3M GOLD Privacy Filter that is a perfect fit for your widescreen laptop, you'll save time and money spent running to the post office for returns and exchanges. See the measuring instructions diagram to determine your perfect fit. <br/><br/> The Element of Surprise. <br/><br/> 3M GOLD Privacy Filters live for the spotlight, especially open, high-traffic environments or where ever on-screen data needs to be kept private. Whether it's staying compliant for work or keeping family photos to yourself, 3M Privacy Filters create a 60-degree No Spy Zone where on-screen data is visible only to those directly in front of your screen. Now you see it. Now they don't. <br/><br/> New Corporate Dress Code. <br/><br/> A 3M GOLD Privacy Filter is more than a power tie for your laptop. It's the fashion-forward way to meet legislative and compliance requirements, and safeguard the security, confidentiality and integrity of mission-critical information. <br/><br/> Utility with Attitude. <br/><br/> How do 3M Privacy Filters protect your on-screen information while making it privy to your eyes? Patented 3M Advanced Light Control Film (ALCF) technology contains closely spaced black micro louvres positioned to one-degree precision, with over a dozen louvrers per millimeter evenly distributed across the screen. It's a mini Venetian blind with no strings attached. Covering You from All Angles. <br/><br/> A laptop donning a 3M GOLD Privacy Filter offers a highly attractive and convenient gateway into your digital life. But what about your mobile handheld device or desktop monitor? While 3M GOLD Privacy Filters are currently available only for laptops and netbooks, rest assured that 3M offers standard framed and frameless privacy filters for your workstation screen and mobile privacy films for cell phones and PDAs, each designed to give you peace of mind from wherever you log in. <br/><br/> heavy-Duty Bling. <br/><br/> Another reason why 3M GOLD Privacy Filters are worth every pretty penny: Today's fragile LCD screens are brighter and easier to view, but easier to scratch, scuff, smudge or damage, making it difficult to view your data. And repairs can be costly and time-consuming. 3M GOLD Privacy Filters are specially designed to protect your screen from ordinary use the moment you place it on your screen.

    "Description": "<p>3M Car Shampoo may be a new arrival in the car care world, but it has drawn on inspiration from over 100 years of experience in supplying some of the world's leading automotive products. Taking all of our expertise into account, we have developed a car shampoo that safely and effectively removes dirt and grime without stripping away wax or other protective layers. <br><br>The unique lubricating formula of this wash allows dirt particles, which would otherwise scratch the paint, to be trapped inside slippery little bubbles that are rinsed away safely  -  resulting in a perfectly clean finish that isn't tainted with unsightly scratches or swirl marks. <br><br>Available in 473Ml bottles, the highly concentrated formula of this shampoo makes it an extremely cost-effective solution. Making up to 100 litres of long-lasting suds, this product will keep on going even when you are worn out! Its pleasant smelling scent makes car washing a joy and the squeaky-clean results will keep you coming back for more.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Step by Step</strong></p> <p>1. Shake container well before use. Dispense 30ml, or 2 caps, of shampoo concentrate into a clean bucket and add 5 litres of warm water. Thoroughly rinse vehicle with water to remove any grit or dirt that could scratch the paint surface. Wash the vehicle using a clean, soft sponge, towel or wash mitt<br>2. Rinse thoroughly then dry using a 3M&trade; Microfibre Detail Cloth or a clean, soft, cotton terry cloth towel or chamois<br>3. To enhance your vehicle's shine easily, use 3M&trade; Quick Wax whilst wiping the vehicle dry</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For more information please refer to <strong><a href=\"http://3mcarcare.co.uk/support/pdf/Car%20Wash%20Soap%2039000.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">instruction sheet</a></strong></p>",

Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream provides long-lasting moisturisation for fragile skin, and forms a barrier on the skin to protect it from other bodily fluids.<br><br> The formula is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way â€“ just a pea-sized amount should be sparingly applied to dry skin. You'll know if you have used too much, as your skin will feel oily. The cream is very long-lasting and is wash-resistant, so you do not have to reapply after every wash. What's more, you can apply adhesive dressings, tape or pads, and the cream will not prevent them from sticking, nor will it clog or cause the dressing material to break down. In some cases, the cream may actually increase the adhesion properties of a dressing or a pad, so apply with caution if your skin is very fragile.<br><br> Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream should not be used on infected areas of skin â€“ for example, fungal infections. Please seek medical advice and the approval of your doctor before you begin using the cream. Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream is available in a cost-effective 92g tube.",

This is provided in single use format, all through a combination six of 3M technology platforms. The hybrid nature of the 3M Emphaze AEX Hybrid Purifier is due to it having both an upstream chromatographic hydrogel and a downstream multi-zone membrane. The chromatographic media has quaternary AEX functionality supported on a polypropylene backbone. This provides a high capacity as two-thirds of the mass is due to the covalently attached cationic polymer. The downstream multi-zone membrane is highly asymmetric, providing a high loading capacity through a twenty fold range in decreasing pore size terminating with a 0.2Âµm bioburden reduction membrane.",

    "Description": "When you have sore skin in a sensitive area, you need to moisturise it and protect it from further irritation. Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream provides long-lasting moisturisation for fragile skin, and forms a barrier on the skin to protect it from other bodily fluids.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The formula is highly concentrated, so a little goes a long way â€“ just a pea-sized amount should be sparingly applied to dry skin. You'll know if you have used too much, as your skin will feel oily. The cream is very long-lasting and is wash-resistant, so you do not have to reapply after every wash. What's more, you can apply adhesive dressings, tape or pads, and the cream will not prevent them from sticking, nor will it clog or cause the dressing material to break down. In some cases, the cream may actually increase the adhesion properties of a dressing or a pad, so apply with caution if your skin is very fragile.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream should not be used on infected areas of skin â€“ for example, fungal infections. Please seek medical advice and the approval of your doctor before you begin using the cream. Cavilon Durable Barrier Cream is available in a cost-effective 92g tube.",

    "Description": "The FUTURO Sport Custom Dial Knee Strap applies targeted pressure on the affected knee tendon without increasing pressure around the entire leg. Pressure is delivered more accurately than a standard knee strap and is maintained until the dial is adjusted. Turning the dial lowers the pad to apply up to 3X more pressure on the tendon and enables pressure to be increased or decreased without adjusting the entire strap. Adjustable hook and loop strap with soft edges provides for a personalised fit and added comfort.",

    "price": 65.95,
    "Description": "Nexcare ColdHot Therapy products are gel-filled compresses with dual purpose: they can provide either flexible ice or soothing heat as a drug-free way to treat pain and inflammation locally. The non-toxic gel is encased in a strong, reliable plastic envelope, which is shaped like a horseshoe to leave the nipple area free and flexible enough to mould to your breast and sit comfortably inside your nursing bra. The compresses are hand washable and reusable, and are supplied with soft fabric protective covers. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or warmed up by placing in hot water. Cold therapy can be an effective way to relieve breast congestion and alleviate pain in the case of mastitis or inflammation; when used warm, the compresses can help to stimulate milk flow, unblock ducts and soothe the discomfort of engorgement. They may also be used as an aid to reduce post-operative swelling and discomfort following breast surgery: Please consult your doctor before purchasing for this purpose. This pack contains 2 x maternity compresses, each with its own soft fabric protective cover. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product. Nexcare ColdHot Gel Compresses are also available in different formats for treating joints and other areas of the body.",

    "Description": "During the first four months of a child's life the visual pathways develop as the eye matures and receives images which are then sent to the brain. For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time. However, if anything interferes with this development, it can result in amblyopia and reduced vision. Amblyopia is a condition that only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years in order to be corrected. <br/><br/>The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child's stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop. The length of time and the number of hours per day that your child is required to wear the patch varies, so it is important to follow the specific treatment routine that is prescribed. <br/><br/>Opticlude Boys & Girls Eye Patches are tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe to provide a comfortable solution to childhood amblyopia. Our Eye Patches are specially designed for children, featuring different sizes, pictures and colours to brighten up their day - and yours! <br/><br/>This pack contains 30 oval maxi Patches, measuring 5.7cm x 8cm, in 3 different colourful patterns. They have a central pad which absorbs excess moisture and are made from a breathable, hypoallergenic and latex-free material. <br/><br/>Easy to apply and remove, now you can make patching a pleasure. <br/><br/>N.B.: Occlusion therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of an orthoptist or other suitably qualified healthcare professional.<br/><br/><strong>This product should only be used as advised by an ophthalmologist.</strong>",

    "Description": "The ScotchÂ® Super Glue Pen contains 2g of advanced formula super glue designed for bonding a wide variety of non-porous materials including wood, metal, some plastics, ceramic and more. Dispensed through a fine, push-point tip, it is ideal for precision tasks requiring only a small amount of glue. The pen is extremely easy to use and gives ultimate control over the amount of glue released onto the surface of your item  -  meaning less mess, a neater finish and reduced wastage. What's more, the tip of the pen resists clogging, sucking excess glue back down to prevent it from drying out, blocking up and rendering the remainder unusable. Once you have finished the job in hand, simply wipe the pen tip with a cloth or tissue, replace the cap and push it on tightly. Store your Scotch Super Glue Pen with the tip upwards in a cool, dry place and you'll find you can use it over and over again. This pack contains 1 Scotch Super Glue Pen. Please note that Scotch Super Glue is not suitable for use on polystyrene foam, foam rubber, polyethylene and polypropylene. Follow the directions for use on the back of the pack carefully.<br><br>ScotchÂ® is a trademark of 3M Company.",

The hooks are easily and cleanly removed without damaging the surface underneath â€“ no cracks, holes, damaged plaster, sticky residue or stains. Want to use the hook again? Just reattach it using a new pair of Command Adhesive Strips. For your convenience spare strips are included in the pack.   Jumbo hooks are a great way to de-clutter your hallway, utility room or garage. They are sturdy and robust enough to hold schoolbags up off the floor and will keep even wet coats and jackets neat and tidy. Command products are perfect in rented accommodation where you canâ€™t put screws in the walls or are worried about marks. They hold strongly on a whole range of surfaces including paint, wood and tiles, but arenâ€™t suitable for use on wallpapered surfaces or for hanging antiques or other valuable or irreplaceable items.   To remove the hook from the wall, grasp the hook and slide it upwards to remove it from the mounting base. The hook and mounting base can be re-used with a new adhesive strip. To remove the Command Adhesive Strips from the wall, hold the base gently and pull the tab straight down, slowly stretching it until the strip releases from the wall. All of these instructions are detailed on the back of the pack.",
