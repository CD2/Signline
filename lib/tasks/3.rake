Repetitive strain injury (RSI) is often caused by a work station that has been set up incorrectly or by the use of inferior equipment. The constant clicking of a traditional" mouse can contribute to RSI and carpal tunnel syndrome. You can help prevent RSI and enhance your productivity with ergonomic workspace solutions from 3M. <br><br>The 3M Wireless Ergonomic Mouse has been clinically proven to reduce muscle strain and discomfort associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive stress injuries, when compared to using a traditional mouse. Its unique, ergonomic design helps to align the arm and shoulder in a more relaxed, neutral position, thereby enhancing user comfort and reducing pressure on the delicate median nerve. In this way, it can help to prevent the onset of RSI; those already suffering from aches and pains in the wrist or hand when using a conventional mouse may see an improvement in symptoms by switching to this product. <br><br>The 3M Wireless Ergonomic Mouse has an optical sensor for smoother, more accurate mouse, and its surfaces are soft-touch painted for added comfort. To use, grip the handle, rest your hand on the base and use your thumb to left and right click or scroll*. Move the entire unit across your mouse mat, rather than using a \'joystick\' motion. Whilst this new shape and movement may take some time to get used to, most users feel comfortable and start to experience benefits within a few days.

The Nexcareâ„¢ ColdHotâ„¢ Back & Abdomen Gel Pack Belt is a drug-free remedy which provides targeted soothing, for comfort where you need it the most.<br/><br/> Our unique ColdHot Technology provides a versatile solution for either a cooling or a warming sensation. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or freezer, or warmed up in the microwave or by placing in hot water. Choose cold therapy to treat acute injuries and relieve the pain of musculoskeletal injury (the cold will help to reduce the swelling, inflammation and pain); or heat to ease pain and reduce muscle spasm associated with chronic back pain, period pain and rheumatoid arthritis.<br/><br/> Nexcareâ„¢ ColdHotâ„¢ Gel Compresses are hand washable and reusable. This pack includes a simple-to-use, adjustable belt that holds the compress in place against the back or abdomen and gives light support. Simply cool or warm up your compress as per the instructions in the box, slip it into the pocket of the belt and secure the belt firmly in place. The belt is composed of several layers of soft, strong fabric, including 3M patented Thinsulateâ„¢ Insulation Material. This helps keep the compress at a constant temperature for longer, giving you prolonged periods of pain relief before you need to re-cool or reheat it. Please note that cold therapy should be applied for a maximum of 20 minutes, before removing the compress for another 20 minutes and then reapplying. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.<br/><br/><strong>Please consult your doctor if pain persists or worsens.</strong>'},

For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time.

Amblyopia is a condition only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years of childhood in order to be corrected. <br/><br/>The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child\'s stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop.

The non-toxic gel is encased in a strong, reliable plastic envelope, which is shaped like a horseshoe to leave the nipple area free and flexible enough to mould to your breast and sit comfortably inside your nursing bra. The compresses are hand washable and reusable, and are supplied with soft fabric protective covers. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or warmed up by placing in hot water. Cold therapy can be an effective way to relieve breast congestion and alleviate pain in the case of mastitis or inflammation; when used warm, the compresses can help to stimulate milk flow, unblock ducts and soothe the discomfort of engorgement. They may also be used as an aid to reduce post-operative swelling and discomfort following breast surgery: Please consult your doctor before purchasing for this purpose. This pack contains 2 x maternity compresses, each with its own soft fabric protective cover. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.
