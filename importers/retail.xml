    <title>3MTM Microfibre Detailing Cloth, 1 Per Pack (39016) (1)</title>
    <product_body>The 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth made from super soft, non-linting microfibre that quickly and effectively removes wax residue, finger marks and even light scratches from vehicle bodywork. Easy to use, it does the hard work for you and makes completing those finishing touches a breeze and is also great with 3MTM Glass Cleaner. As with all of our products, we pride ourselves on the incredibly high quality of the 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth. Designed to be durable, hardworking and long lasting, it offers excellent value for money and comes highly recommended by automotive professionals and customers who have used it at home. If you only have one detailing cloth in your collection, this is definitely the one to choose. The 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth performs well with all of the cleaning products in the 3M Car Care Range and is the ideal accessory for cleaning, polishing and dusting inside and out. Its super soft construction won&apos;t scratch surfaces but as with any detailing cloth, be careful to use it only on clean surfaces and shake it out regularly. Any particles that it picks up could cause scratches. Step by Step 1. Fold cloth into quarters to create a flat uniform surface. Wipe surface to remove any residue and buff to a high shine with a clean section of the cloth 2. Unfold and refold the cloth frequently to expose a clean surface in order to avoid scratching by particles which may have been picked up by the cloth 3. Because of the Detail Cloth&apos;s superior dust and dirt lifting and trapping properties, frequent washing is recommended. The cloth is hot water, chlorine bleach and dryer safe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32pwiKv80Q</product_body>

    <title>3M Ultrathon Insect Repellent Lotion</title>
    <product_body>Ultrathon Lotion provides long lasting protection from biting insects via advanced 3M Time Release Technology, with up to 12 hour protection against mosquitoes from one application. Recommended by Ray Mears, the TV expert on bushcraft and survival, this insect repellent lotion will ensure you and your family have a high level of protection both for holidays to tropical climates and for breaks and outdoor trips closer to home. This is also the product of choice for the UK Armed Forces. Ultrathon Lotion comes in a 60 ml tube and contains 34% DEET. The Ultrathon formula contains 3M Time Release Technology, meaning the DEET is released slowly, over a longer period of time compared to conventional products. One benefit of a lower DEET content is that the product is also suitable in lower risk environments; another is a more pleasant odour for the user, since the DEET smell is not so strong. The Ultrathon formulation is also splash and sweat resistant, affording long lasting protection even when you are active, against a range of biting insects--including mosquitoes, midges, ticks, fleas, gnats and biting flies.</product_body>

    <title>15m White Reflektif&reg; Reflective Curtain Grade Tape (ECE 104) - Solid Style</title>
    <product_body>Reflective tape for use on Lorry&apos;s, trucks, vans, cars, trailers, caravans and motor homes etc. it could also be used on motor bikes, cycles, invalid cars and even wheelchairs. Basically any rigid area on a vehicle (not for use on fabric curtains on trucks etc). Tape can easily be applied to the vehicle, instructions are supplied, once correctly applied you can power wash the car, van, truck, caravan etc without the risk of the tape coming off, and their is no need to specially the treat the tape for this to work, simply clean the surface of the vehicle, remove the backing paper and stick it on!

    <title>Yellow Reflexite Reflective Vehicle Tape (ECE 104) 1 Metre Long 50mm Wide</title>
    <product_body>Reflective tape designed for application onto vehicles and trailers (with rigid surfaces) to meet regulation ECE104. It is especially important for haulage companies who&apos;s vehicles travel into Europe as this has now become a legal requirement. You can use White or Yellow on the sides of a vehicle and yellow or red on the rear. Amendments to the UK Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 (RVLR) The Department for Transport has made a commitment to align RVLR with UNECE Regulation 48 and require conspicuity marking material to be fitted to new heavy goods vehicles and their trailers from 10 July 2011. DfT has completed amendments to the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 which entered into force on 4 January 2010, detailing the requirements for conspicuity markings including optionally-fitted markings. Rear marker plates which have been mandatory on certain vehicles and trailers for some time in the UK are intended to serve the same function as conspicuity marking material, so DfT has made the decision not to mandate both. Optionally-fitted conspicuity markings. The amendments allow vehicles to be fitted with optional conspicuity markings, but where fitted they are required to conform to the relevant ECE Regulation 48 requirements. If compliant conspicuity markings are optionally-fitted to vehicles, then there is no requirement to fit rear marker plates to vehicles. However, the optional use of rear marking plates in addition to conspicuity markings will continue to be permitted. The RVLR have also being updated to require rear marker plates, when fitted optionally from the mandatory conspicuity marking implementation date of 10 July 2011, to comply with the latest technical specifications set out in UN ECE Regulation 70.01. This aligns with the latest requirements in UN ECE Regulation 48.</product_body>

You can use White or Yellow on the sides of a vehicle and yellow or red on the rear. Amendments to the UK Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 (RVLR) The Department for Transport has made a commitment to align RVLR with UNECE Regulation 48 and require conspicuity marking material to be fitted to new heavy goods vehicles and their trailers from 10 July 2011. DfT has completed amendments to the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 which entered into force on 4 January 2010, detailing the requirements for conspicuity markings including optionally-fitted markings. Rear marker plates which have been mandatory on certain vehicles and trailers for some time in the UK are intended to serve the same function as conspicuity marking material, so DfT has made the decision not to mandate both. Optionally-fitted conspicuity markings. The amendments allow vehicles to be fitted with optional conspicuity markings, but where fitted they are required to conform to the relevant ECE Regulation 48 requirements. If compliant conspicuity markings are optionally-fitted to vehicles, then there is no requirement to fit rear marker plates to vehicles. However, the optional use of rear marking plates in addition to conspicuity markings will continue to be permitted. The RVLR have also being updated to require rear marker plates, when fitted optionally from the mandatory conspicuity marking implementation date of 10 July 2011, to comply with the latest technical specifications set out in UN ECE Regulation 70.01. This aligns with the latest requirements in UN ECE Regulation 48.</product_body>

    <title>3M Ultrathon Insect Repellent Lotion</title>
    <product_body>Ultrathon Lotion provides long lasting protection from biting insects via advanced 3M Time Release Technology, with up to 12 hour protection against mosquitoes from one application. Recommended by Ray Mears, the TV expert on bushcraft and survival, this insect repellent lotion will ensure you and your family have a high level of protection both for holidays to tropical climates and for breaks and outdoor trips closer to home. This is also the product of choice for the UK Armed Forces. Ultrathon Lotion comes in a 60 ml tube and contains 34% DEET. The Ultrathon formula contains 3M Time Release Technology, meaning the DEET is released slowly, over a longer period of time compared to conventional products. One benefit of a lower DEET content is that the product is also suitable in lower risk environments; another is a more pleasant odour for the user, since the DEET smell is not so strong. The Ultrathon formulation is also splash and sweat resistant, affording long lasting protection even when you are active, against a range of biting insects--including mosquitoes, midges, ticks, fleas, gnats and biting flies.</product_body>

    <title>JL AUDIO M700/5 MARINE AMP</title>
    <product_body>M700/5 5-Channel Class D Marine System Amplifier, 75 W x 4 @ 4 &amp;#x3A9; + 300 W x 1 @ 2 &amp;#x3A9; - 14.4V M700/5 Product Spotlight The M700/5 is ideal for a complete audiophile-grade, subwoofer + four satellite system, and it fits comfortably in just about any boat&apos;s weather-tight compartments. With this incredible little amplifier, you can drive two pairs of quality component speaker systems with plenty of clean power (75 W x 4 @ 4 &amp;#x3A9;), while also delivering a stout 300 W of power to a subwoofer system. The breakthrough that makes this much power possible in such a small chassis is our NexDTM switching design. The M700/5 includes a 12 dB / octave high-pass filter for one main channel pair, a 12 dB octave high-pass or bandpass filter for the other main channel pair, plus a variable slope low-pass filter for its subwoofer channel. All three filters offer continuously variable cutoff frequency selection from 50-500 Hz. This amplifier&apos;s filters can also be configured as a true 3-way crossover, with a low-pass filter for the subwoofer channel, a bandpass filter on Ch. 3 &amp; 4, and a high-pass filter on Ch. 1 &amp; 2. An &quot;x10&quot; multiplier switch on the Ch. 1 &amp; 2 high-pass filter allows its cutoff frequency to be adjusted from 50-500 Hz or 500-5000 Hz. With the addition of an HD-RLC remote level control (sold separately), the amplifier&apos;s subwoofer channel level or overall level can be directly controlled from a remote location. This marine amplifier features white and gray powder-coat finishes, a gasketed cover for the controls and stainless steel hardware for durability in the marine environment.</product_body>

    <title>5.25&quot;&quot; (130mm) Coaxial Speaker System with .075&quot;&quot;(19mm)Silk Dome Component Tweet</title>
    <product_body>For a car speaker to excel it must be thoroughly engineered in all areas. The woofer design must deliver sufficient efficiency, smooth mid-range response and good low-frequency extension. The tweeter must be smooth off-axis, exhibit good extension and be non-fatiguing, while the crossover design must seamlessly blend the sound of the drivers so that the end result is clean, realistic audio performance.In designing the new C2 Coaxial and Component Systems, we have drawn from our vast experience in woofer design as well as the tweeter technologies employed in our world-class C5 component systems. The resulting products deliver a compelling performance solution at a price within reach of any enthusiast seeking a great listening experience.Continuous Power Handling: 60 WattsRec. Power Range (per channel): 15 - 100 WattsSystem Efficiency: 90.5 dB @ 1W/1mSystem Nominal Impedance: 4ohmsSystemFrequency Response: 59 Hz - 22 KHz &plusmn; 3 dB</product_body>

    <title>Garmin Edge 1000 GPS Bike Computer with Premium Heart Rate Monitor and Speed and Cadence Sensors</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionThe Cycle Computer for Competing, Connecting and Navigating    Edge 1000 is a cycling computer for competing, connecting, and navigating.      Whether you&apos;re riding to improve your own personal best or see where you stand against the Pro&apos;s, Edge 1000 lets you connect, compare and compete. Turn every ride into a race by competing on Garmin Connect segments and seeing real-time results on your Edge, including alerts for segment start and finish and leaderboard rankings. The segments feature keeps you motivated and helps you push for continual improvement. Garmin Connect is a free online that can be used for tracking performance, downloading training plans, getting information on segments and leaderboards and more.          Edge 1000: Race The Segments              Own the Road           Along with in-ride challenges and connected features, Edge 1000 offers bike-specific navigation and mapping capabilities. The preloaded Garmin Cycle Map includes OSM (Open Street Map) content with routable road and cycle paths, elevation data, points of interest and address search. Mapping data is stored onboard the Edge, so your access to navigation and performance capabilities isn&amp;#x2019;t dependent on mobile phone coverage, and map updates are free.                                 Edge 1000: Round Trip Routing      Know Where to Go  Now you can explore more, on and off-road, thanks to this device&amp;#x2019;s round-trip routing feature. Simply enter how far you want to ride, and Edge 1000 calculates up to 3 cycling-friendly routes. You can even review the elevation profiles before making your selection. It also offers a route planner capability that allows you to create routes directly on the Edge 1000 using the map, POI and segments you&amp;#x2019;ve downloaded from Garmin Connect. Again, you can preview the elevation profile of your custom route before you roll. If you do get off course or want to end your ride sooner, Edge can always guide you back to the start or calculate the most direct route and provide turn-by-turn directions to get you back.    At Your Fingertips    Edge 1000 features a 3-inch high-resolution colour touchscreen display with dual orientation*. It has an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts the screen brightness to changing light conditions to improve visibility. Unlike your smartphone, the display is optimised to work with gloves and in the rain&amp;#xB3;. You can customise your training pages with up to 10 data fields and use activity profiles to allow for easy transitions when you switch cycling activity, such as road, mountain or touring.                Edge 1000: Easy-To-See Touchscreen              Performance Analysis            This Edge 1000 comes with a compatible ANT+ speed and cadence sensor as well as a heart rate monitor. It&amp;#x2019;s the first Garmin cycle computer that integrates with Shimano Di2 electronic shifting systems4 to display your current gear on the screen. Edge 1000 is also compatible with other ANT+ power meters, including VectorTM, Garmin&amp;#x2019;s pedal-based power meter that measures total power, left/right balance and cadence. A preloaded power-based workout on Edge 1000 allows you to calculate your functional threshold power (FTP), from which you can base your power training zones. The 1000 offers a training calendar and is compatible with advanced workouts, which you can plan, schedule and upload from Garmin Connect.    Smartphone Connectivity  When paired with your smartphone and the Garmin Connect Mobile app, Edge 1000 offers a suite of connected features, including live tracking, incoming call and text alerts, social media sharing, weather, wireless uploads and the sending/receiving of courses and segments. As soon as your ride is complete, the data can be automatically sent to Garmin Connect via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. This lets you stay connected and instantly share the details of your ride with friends, family and social media contacts. LiveTrack allows your friends and family to follow your races and training activities in real time. Invite followers using email or social media, so they can view your live data on a Garmin Connect tracking page. Once they get your email invite, they can click to follow and see your stats and location on the map.

    <title>OpticludeTM Boys &amp; Girls Orthoptic Eye Patches - Mini Size Pack 30 Coloured Patches</title>
    <product_body>During the first four months of a child&apos;s life the visual pathways develop as the eye matures and receives images which are then sent to the brain. For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time. However, if anything interferes with this development, it can result in amblyopia and reduced vision. Amblyopia is a condition that only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years in order to be corrected. The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child&apos;s stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop. The length of time and the number of hours per day that your child is required to wear the patch varies, so it is important to follow the specific treatment routine that is prescribed. OpticludeTM Boys &amp; Girls Eye Patches are tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe to provide a comfortable solution to childhood amblyopia. Our Eye Patches are specially designed for children, featuring different sizes, pictures and colours to brighten up their day - and yours! This pack contains 30 oval mini patches, measuring 5cm x 6cm, in 3 different colourful patterns. They have a central pad which absorbs excess moisture and are made from a breathable, hypoallergenic and latex-free material. Easy to apply and remove, now you can make patching a pleasure. N.B.: Occlusion therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of an orthoptist or other suitably qualified healthcare professional. This product should only be used as advised by an ophthalmologist.</product_body>

    <title>Command Medium Antique Bronze Hooks with Strips (FC12-AB)</title>
    <product_body>Package Quantity: 1&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Style Name: BronzeProduct DescriptionGive your bits and pieces a place to live with Command Antique Bronze Hooks. These decorative metal hooks can each hold up to 1kg in weight, making them the ideal organisational solution for your home or office. They can be applied to almost any flat, clean surface. When you want to rearrange, the hooks are easily and cleanly removed without damaging the surface underneath &amp;#x2013; no cracks, holes, damaged plaster, sticky residue or stains. Want to use a hook again? Just reattach it using a new Command Adhesive Strip &amp;#x2013; each pack includes a spare, and refill packs are available. These antique-effect hooks will complement classic home d&amp;#xE9;cor perfectly. The medium-sized version is ideal for hanging coats, towels and bathrobes. Many Command fans tell us that they use this type of hook to display their Christmas wreath on the front door, as the antique finish matches the rest of their door furniture. Once January rolls around, it&amp;#x2019;s easy to take down the hook without damaging the paintwork underneath, and the hook can be used year after year with replacement adhesive strips. Command products are perfect in rented accommodation where you can&amp;#x2019;t put screws in the walls or are worried about marks and stains. They hold strongly on a whole range of surfaces including paint, wood, metal and tiles, but aren&amp;#x2019;t suitable for use on wallpapered surfaces or for hanging antiques or other valuable or irreplaceable items. When you want to take one down, grasp the hook and slide it upwards to remove it from the mounting base. The hook and mounting base can be re-used with a new adhesive strip. To remove the Command Adhesive Strip from the wall, hold the plastic base gently and pull the tab straight down, slowly stretching it until the strip releases from the wall. All of these instructions are detailed on the back of the pack. Command is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains1 pack, each containing 1 hook and 2 medium adhesive strips.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch Super Glue Pen (505569) - 2g</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionThe Scotch Super Glue Pen contains 2g of advanced formula super glue designed for bonding a wide variety of non-porous materials including wood, metal, some plastics, ceramic and more. Dispensed through a fine, push-point tip, it is ideal for precision tasks requiring only a small amount of glue. The pen is extremely easy to use and gives ultimate control over the amount of glue released onto the surface of your item &amp;#x2013; meaning less mess, a neater finish and reduced wastage. What&amp;#x2019;s more, the tip of the pen resists clogging, sucking excess glue back down to prevent it from drying out, blocking up and rendering the remainder unusable. Once you have finished the job in hand, simply wipe the pen tip with a cloth or tissue, replace the cap and push it on tightly.

    <title>Scotch Super Glue Liquid in a Precision Applicator (SGAD-874) - 4g</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionScotch Super Glue Liquid is advanced formula super glue that bonds securely to wood, metal, some plastics, ceramic and more. What sets it apart from the rest is the patented droplet control technology incorporated into its precision applicator &amp;#x2013; meaning you get up to 60% less mess compared to traditional metal tube super glue liquids. It is ideal for fiddly tasks where precision is essential, accurately dispensing one drop of glue at a time right where you need it. You&amp;#x2019;re far less likely to end up gluing your fingers together, or sticking something to the workbench or table!With the Scotch Super Glue Precision Applicator, you&amp;#x2019;ll also cut down on wastage. This &amp;#x201C;stay fresh&amp;#x201D;, clog-resistant bottle sucks excess liquid back down from the opening to prevent it from drying out, blocking up the top and rendering the remainder unusable. Once you have finished the job in hand, simply wipe the applicator tip with a cloth or tissue, replace the cap and screw it on tightly. Store your bottle of Scotch Super Glue Liquid with the tip upwards in a cool, dry place and you&amp;#x2019;ll find you can use it over and over again.Please note that Scotch Super Glue Liquid is not suitable for use on polystyrene foam, foam rubber, polyethylene and polypropylene. Follow the directions for use on the back of the pack carefully.Scotch is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains1 bottle containing 4g of liquid super glue</product_body>

    <title>Watercolour Paper Stretcher Half Imperial</title>
    <product_body>Ideal for watercolour classes. Stretch your watercolour paper with ease - No more gum strip! This infallible device takes the chore out of stretching watercolour paper of all weights. You will never need to buy brown paper tape again! All who have attempted watercolour painting will know the frustration of painting on un-stretched paper...even the heaviest papers can cockle and buckle under a wash, causing the paint to flow unevenly and ruining your work. Let&apos;s face it...watercolour painting can be difficult enough, so anything which makes it technically easier has to be a bonus. The cure is to pre-stretch your paper. Normally this means soaking the paper and then sticking it to your drawing board with pins or old-fashioned brown-paper tape, both very haphazard methods. Get the paper too wet and it can tear as it dries or even break the board. Get the tape too wet and it won&apos;t stick at all! Furthermore you have to let the paper dry naturally which can take several hours. As a watercolour teacher the inventor of this system needed a reliable device to stretch several sheets a day quickly and effortlessly, hence this invention. No tape, No clips, No fuss.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature> Made in the UK.</feature>
      <feature> No need for gummed tape.</feature>

All who have attempted watercolour painting will know the frustration of painting on un-stretched paper...even the heaviest papers can cockle and buckle under a wash, causing the paint to flow unevenly and ruining your work. Let&apos;s face it...watercolour painting can be difficult enough, so anything which makes it technically easier has to be a bonus. The cure is to pre-stretch your paper. Normally this means soaking the paper and then sticking it to your drawing board with pins or old-fashioned brown-paper tape, both very haphazard methods. Get the paper too wet and it can tear as it dries or even break the board. Get the tape too wet and it won&apos;t stick at all! Furthermore you have to let the paper dry naturally which can take several hours. As a watercolour teacher the inventor of this system needed a reliable device to stretch several sheets a day quickly and effortlessly, hence this invention. No tape, No clips, No fuss.</product_body>

    <title>Numatic WV570-2 Wet &amp; Dry 15 Litres 110v</title>
    <product_body>Numatic WV570 Wet and Dry Clearner 15 Litre. When the need is for bigger but still portable commercial wet and drys, the Numatic WV570 sets an entirely new standard.  Firstly there is the full Structofoam construction - a Numatic first unmatched worldwide. Structofoam is a material formulation embodying all the strength needed for bigger machines, yet without weight penalty. It is truly rugged.

To this high standard you then add the full dry performance specification, with large filters providing performance to hospital standards and optional big capacity disposable filter bags that ensure simplicity and cleanliness when emptying.  In the wet operation mode the unique spinning ball valve ensures safety in operation, whilst the &apos;bucket&apos; design of the container provides a simple and practical method of emptying for a mcahine of this size. The WV570 is supplied as standard with a truly professional 38 mm. wet and dry kit comprising a 2.5 metre Nuflex double swivel hose, 3-piece stainless steel tubeset and two Multiflo&apos; 400 mm. floor nozzles - one for dry use, one for wet - which are also of Structofoam construction. When you&apos;re looking for a machine that will go on and on, wet or dry, the WV570 is surely a commercial must.

    <title>3MTM Stainless Steel Cleaner - Aerosol Can</title>
    <product_body>When you have steel or metal surfaces that need a deep clean and a brilliant streak-free shine, polish up your act with 3M Stainless Steel Cleaner &amp; Polish. With a pleasant citrus aroma, this high performance product cleans, polishes and restores a glossy sheen to stainless steel and other metal surfaces.

A little goes a long way, clinging to the surface with a small spray pattern that reduces waste. This product is suitable for use on stainless steel, chrome, aluminium, laminated plastics, enamel, Plexiglas and ceramics. For best results, use with a Scotch-BriteTM Microfibre Cleaning Cloth.

    <title>3M SandBlaster 02580UK Coarse P80 115mm x 2.5m Sandpaper Roll with Paint Stripping</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionWhen you are faced with the task of stripping old paint, SandBlaster abrasives can make the job of sanding less work, whilst providing superior quality results. The 2.5m roll is compact and great for tool boxes: it&amp;#x2019;s easy to cut or tear pieces off for hand sanding or use with an electrical sander. Sandblaster can be used on a wide range of surfaces including wood, metal, plastic, filler and fibreglass, and has a special coating to resist clogging. When dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! SandBlaster Sandpaper is coated evenly with mineral and features an advanced backing material that resists tearing: the result is a long-lasting, durable sandpaper that cuts up to three times faster, stays sharp and delivers a more consistent finish when compared to conventional alternatives of comparable grits.SandBlaster Sandpaper in coarse P80 grit is the ideal choice for challenging tasks such as removing layers of old paint or varnish, or eliminating ingrained marks and blemishes from wood and metal. This pack contains 1 roll of long-lasting sandpaper which measures 115mm wide x 2.5m long. To make hand sanding easier, why not try the 3M Rubber Sanding Block? Simply attach a piece of Sandblaster Sandpaper to the heavyweight block for an improved grip, extra power and better sanding control.SandBlaster Sandpaper: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.SandBlaster is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains1 x 1 roll of 3M SandBlaster Sandpaper</product_body>

    <product_body>Product DescriptionFor over 30 years, Post-it Notes have given us a clear, simple and effective way to make a note, send a message or leave a reminder. They have helped us communicate, kept us organised and made life easier at home and in the office. With Post-it Full Adhesive Notes, you&amp;#x2019;ll find a host of new uses for them - whether you&amp;#x2019;re busy keeping your family on a hectic schedule, staying organised in the office, or working on the go.Post-it Full Adhesive Notes have a larger area of Super Sticky adhesive that covers all but one edge of each sheet &amp;#x2013; meaning they have more holding power and stay put for longer, whilst still removing cleanly when required. The two rounded corners on the non-adhesive edge are less likely to curl or become dog-eared over time, and make it quick and easy to find and peel each sheet off the pad. The result is a note that sticks securely and lies flat for a more reliable hold and a neat, professional look.Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are the ideal solution for high traffic areas or items that are handled frequently, such as long term project documents, instruction manuals and operating procedures. Their increased holding power means they stick better to walls, doors, fridges, purses and briefcases so you can be sure that your message gets through. Organising on the move? The pads hold securely inside folders, diaries, notebooks and portfolios, and this smaller size will fit perfectly on the back of a smartphone or inside a wallet. Simply peel away the last two sheets from the pad and stick it anywhere you might need a note &amp;#x2013; great when you&amp;#x2019;re working on the train or with clients, hot-desking, or just packing a lot into your day!

    <title>Post-it Super Sticky 76mm x 76mm Full Adhesive Notes Pad - Electric Yellow (Pack of 4, 25 Notes Per Pad)</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionFor over 30 years, Post-it Notes have given us a clear, simple and effective way to make a note, send a message or leave a reminder. They have helped us communicate, kept us organised and made life easier at home and in the office. With Post-it Full Adhesive Notes, you&amp;#x2019;ll find a host of new uses for them - whether you&amp;#x2019;re busy keeping your family on a hectic schedule, staying organised in the office, or working on the go.Post-it Full Adhesive Notes have a larger area of Super Sticky adhesive that covers all but one edge of each sheet &amp;#x2013; meaning they have more holding power and stay put for longer, whilst still removing cleanly when required. The two rounded corners on the non-adhesive edge are less likely to curl or become dog-eared over time, and make it quick and easy to find and peel each sheet off the pad. The result is a note that sticks securely and lies flat for a more reliable hold and a neat, professional look.Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are the ideal solution for high traffic areas or items that are handled frequently, such as long term project documents, instruction manuals and operating procedures. Their increased holding power means they stick better to walls, doors, fridges, purses and briefcases so you can be sure that your message gets through. Organising on the move? These pads hold securely inside folders, diaries, notebooks and portfolios. Simply peel away the last two sheets from the pad and stick it anywhere you might need a note &amp;#x2013; great when you&amp;#x2019;re working on the train or with clients, hot-desking, or just packing a lot into your day! Mobile, versatile and reliable: with Post-it Full Adhesive Notes you&amp;#x2019;ll always have a note within reach, wherever you are.This pack contains 4 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes in bright Electric Yellow. Each pad measures 76mm x 76mm and contains 25 notes. Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are also available in assorted colours and a smaller size.Post-it is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains4 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes</product_body>

    <title>Post-it Super Sticky 76 x 76mm Adhesive Notes Pad - Assorted Colours (Pack of 2, 25 Notes Per Pad)</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionFor over 30 years, Post-it Notes have given us a clear, simple and effective way to make a note, send a message or leave a reminder. They have helped us communicate, kept us organised and made life easier at home and in the office. With Post-it Full Adhesive Notes, you&amp;#x2019;ll find a host of new uses for them - whether you&amp;#x2019;re busy keeping your family on a hectic schedule, staying organised in the office, or working on the go.Post-it Full Adhesive Notes have a larger area of Super Sticky adhesive that covers all but one edge of each sheet &amp;#x2013; meaning they have more holding power and stay put for longer, whilst still removing cleanly when required. The two rounded corners on the non-adhesive edge are less likely to curl or become dog-eared over time, and make it quick and easy to find and peel each sheet off the pad. The result is a note that sticks securely and lies flat for a more reliable hold and a neat, professional look.Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are the ideal solution for high traffic areas or items that are handled frequently, such as long term project documents, instruction manuals and operating procedures. Their increased holding power means they stick better to walls, doors, fridges, purses and briefcases so you can be sure that your message gets through. Organising on the move? These pads hold securely inside folders, diaries, notebooks and portfolios. Simply peel away the last two sheets from the pad and stick it anywhere you might need a note &amp;#x2013; great when you&amp;#x2019;re working on the train or with clients, hot-desking, or just packing a lot into your day! Mobile, versatile and reliable: with Post-it Full Adhesive Notes you&amp;#x2019;ll always have a note within reach, wherever you are.This trial pack contains 2 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes in assorted colours. Each pad measures 76mm x 76mm and contains 25 notes. Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are also available in packs of 4 pads (76mm x 76mm) or 8 pads (50.8mm x 50.8mm).Post-it is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains2 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes</product_body>

    <title>Filtrete FAPF03 Ultra Clean Large Air Purifier Replacement Filter - For Filtrete Air Purifier Model: FAP03 - 1 Filter</title>
    <product_body>Style Name: White&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Size: 1 - PackProduct Description3M recommends you change the filter of your Filtrete Room Air Purifier after three months of continuous use to ensure the particles removed during filtration are not returned to the environment during cleaning, ensure the electrostatic benefits of the filter are maintained and maintain its effectiveness. Filtrete Air Purifiers are a new and intelligent solution from the name that delivers cleaner indoor air. They offer an unrivalled combination of low noise, high Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) and value for money and are up to 30% more effective than an equivalent HEPA filter. Filtrete Room Air Purifiers use patented technology that has enabled 3M to produce a less dense filter than equivalent HEPA filters. This means dramatically more air can pass through a Filtrete Room Air Purifer and the result is much quicker circulation and cleaning of the air. Most permanent and washable filters quickly lose their electrostatic properties through washing and clogging. By using replacable filters, Filtrete air purifiers deliver the enhanced filtration of a electrostatic filter on a sustained basis. Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a measure of an air cleaner&apos;s delivery of particle-free air and is calculated through independent laboratory tests. The CADR indicates volume of filtered air delivered by an air purifier: the higher the tobacco smoke, pollen and dust numbers, the faster the unit filters the air. Filtrete purifiers are up to 99.9% effective at removing pollen, dust mite debris and mould spores from the air and use patented filter technology that allows more air to pass through the purifier. As a result, allergens are removed more quickly.Manufacturer&apos;s Description3M recommends you change the filter of your Filtrete Room Air Purifier after three months of continuous use to ensure the particles removed during filtration are not returned to the environment during cleaning, ensure the electrostatic benefits of the filter are maintained and maintain its effectiveness. Filtrete Air Purifiers are a new and intelligent solution from the name that delivers cleaner indoor air. They offer an unrivalled combination of low noise, high Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) and value for money and are up to 30% more effective than an equivalent HEPA filter. Filtrete Room Air Purifiers use patented technology that has enabled 3M to produce a less dense filter than equivalent HEPA filters. This means dramatically more air can pass through a Filtrete Room Air Purifer and the result is much quicker circulation and cleaning of the air. Most permanent and washable filters quickly lose their electrostatic properties through washing and clogging. By using replacable filters, Filtrete air purifiers deliver the enhanced filtration of a electrostatic filter on a sustained basis. Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a measure of an air cleaner&apos;s delivery of particle-free air and is calculated through independent laboratory tests. The CADR indicates volume of filtered air delivered by an air purifier: the higher the tobacco smoke, pollen and dust numbers, the faster the unit filters the air. Filtrete purifiers are up to 99.9% effective at removing pollen, dust mite debris and mould spores from the air and use patented filter technology that allows more air to pass through the purifier. As a result, allergens are removed more quickly.See all Product Description</product_body>

    <title>Scotch Book Repair Tape, 50.8mm x 13.7m, 1 roll</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionTrust Scotch Book Repair Tape to help you mend books, magazines, folders and more, giving you many more years of enjoyment. This tough, crystal clear, self-adhesive tape is strong and reliable - perfect for use at home, in the office and at school. Use it to repair or reinforce the spine, edges, covers and pages of books, magazines, journals, binders and even record sleeves, preserving your most useful and treasured items for years to come. Pliable and conformable, this tape will adhere to even the most awkward corners and folds to give a secure, long-lasting seal that flexes with cover or page movements. The acid-free adhesive is safe to use on photographs and sensitive papers, and will not yellow, dry out or split over time. Scotch Book Repair Tape is great for those favourite paperbacks that you come back to time and again, or lend out to friends, only for the cover to start to separate or pages come loose. Use this tape along the length of the spine and fold it around to protect the seam that joins the front and back covers. Run lengths of tape inside the spine to reattach loose pages, and even to repair ones that may have torn. Children&amp;#x2019;s books are notoriously difficult to keep in a good condition, but Scotch Book Repair Tape will help you mend their all-time favourites, and reinforce the corners and edges of new purchases to make them sturdier. Because the tape is so clear, you could also use it to fix labels to the spines of your books, folders and binders &amp;#x2013; great for the office, libraries, nurseries, schools, students and the super-organised! Scotch Book Repair Tape is easy to use. It unwinds smoothly and gives you the chance to position and reposition the strip carefully before pressing down to seal it permanently.

    <title>Scotch Magic Tape 900 Natural Fibre Film 19mm x 33m (Pack of 3)</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionScotch Magic Tape is the essential tape for home, school and office. This strong, general purpose tape looks opaque on the roll, but is virtually invisible when applied. It has a smooth, matte surface which doesn&amp;#x2019;t reflect light and therefore won&amp;#x2019;t draw attention to itself, giving you a neat and seamless look. It can be written on with pen, pencil or marker, so is great for annotating documents or making labels. It won&amp;#x2019;t dry out or &amp;#x2018;yellow&amp;#x2019; with age, and its low reflectivity means that it won&amp;#x2019;t ghost on photocopies &amp;#x2013; perfect when you need to attach photos, graphics, or other small items to backing pages in order to photocopy them. It is photo-safe and ideal for all general purpose home, office and school tasks such as document mending, sealing envelopes, school projects, scrapbooks and crafts. Thanks to its gentle adhesive, you can stick then re-stick each piece as your project demands, then jot a helpful note with a pen or pencil on top when you&apos;re done. Scotch Magic Tape &amp;#x2013; A Greener Choice is a more eco-friendly tape than traditional alternatives, but offers the same great performance. It is made from more than 53% plant-based materials, including a plant-based, solvent-free adhesive. The core is made from 100% recycled cardboard, and rolls are packaged in boxes made from more than 83% recycled cardboard. This pack consists of 1 box, containing 3 rolls of tape. Each roll measures 19mm wide by 33m long. Scotch Magic Tape can easily be torn by hand, but a wide range of dispensers are available in a variety of colours, shapes and formats to fit with your workspace or lifestyle.Scotch is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains1 box, containing 3 rolls of Scotch Magic Tape - A Greener Choice</product_body>

    <product_body>A bespoke item designed and manufactured by SignLine as we couldn&apos;t find a suitable monitor stand available anywhere else. The cast acrylics used give a nice gloss finish, the monitor is at eye level and the compartments give plenty of storage space to help keep your desk tidy. The stand is supplied in flat pack form, I have glued one together and another 3 have been slotted together, a tube of super glue is included which you can use to adhere the stand together if you prefer but it is best to assemble a few times to be sure you are happy doing that before adhering. A small amount of super glue can be placed into a channel at a time before placing the sections in. Assemble as shown in the photo&apos;s, the top is last to go on and locks all the sections together.</product_body>

    <title>A4 10mm Print Foam (Pack of 10 Sheets)</title>
    <product_body>Our smooth-surface Printfoam is 10mm thick allowing deeper and more detailed impressions and is ideal for use as a fun and safe introduction to block printing for younger users. Impressions can be made in the foam blocks using either pointed or even relatively blunt objects (a pencil or wooden lollypop stick) or draw directly into the sheet to create an image. To make a print simply use an ink roller to apply block printing inkto the surface in the normal way. Printfoam can be easily cut into shapes with a craft knife or scissors, and is commonly used for model making.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Scourers With Nailsaver Design 2 Packs of 2 Pads</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-Brite has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. When you need to shift stubborn grease or burnt-on food, Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Scourers With Nailsaver Design will quickly scour and clean, working up to 50% faster than similar sponge scourers and with twice the efficiency. Their easy-grip design makes them comfortable to hold, whilst their coarse scouring surface makes cleaning a breeze. For worry-free washing up, these pads have a unique design which protects your nails, reducing the need for gloves and the likelihood of broken nails. Once you&apos;ve powered through the pots, use the super absorbent sponge to wipe down surfaces and the sink. Thanks to their heavy duty cleaning power, these scourers are not suitable for non-stick, delicate or highly polished surfaces. This pack contains 2 Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scourers with Nailsaver Design, which can be re-used by washing in either the dishwasher or in boiling water. We recommend that before using them on a new surface you test first on an inconspicuous area and allow to dry to verify no surface damage.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Mini Lint Roller Coloured Handles</title>
    <product_body>Scotch-BriteTM Mini Lint Roller Coloured Handles. Fluff, pet-hair and dust are part of everyday life, but they can make your clothes, furniture or car look dirty or unkempt. Scotch-BriteTM Lint Rollers have been developed with &quot;sticky&quot; technology to quickly lift lint, fluff, pet-hair, dust and other dry residue from car seats, upholstery and even your clothes without damaging fabric. Hold the lint roller by the ergonomically-designed handle and pass the roll across the fabric you wish to clean. When the top-sheet is covered with fluff and appears to have reduced stickiness, tear it off at the perforation to reveal a new sticky sheet beneath. Save the label to wrap around the outside of your lint roller and you&apos;ll stop it from sticking to everything else in your drawer or picking up dirt when you&apos;re not using it. A must-have for pet owners, they are also great to keep handy in the car, in your desk or by the front door for a quick spruce up of your clothing before you leave. This mini size is perfectly proportioned for keeping in your briefcase, glove box or handbag - for a neat neckline or a spotless suit on-the-go. This item is a mini lint roller with a comfortably-designed handle and perforated &quot;sticky&quot; sheets. It offers superior adhesion and is quick and easy to use - this is how we roll!</product_body>

    <title>Nexcare Coldhot Maternity Compress</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionNexcare ColdHot Therapy products are gel-filled compresses with dual purpose: they can provide either flexible ice or soothing heat as a drug-free way to treat pain and inflammation locally. The non-toxic gel is encased in a strong, reliable plastic envelope, which is shaped like a horseshoe to leave the nipple area free and flexible enough to mould to your breast and sit comfortably inside your nursing bra.The compresses are hand washable and reusable, and are supplied with soft fabric protective covers. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or warmed up by placing in hot water. Cold therapy can be an effective way to relieve breast congestion and alleviate pain in the case of mastitis or inflammation; when used warm, the compresses can help to stimulate milk flow, unblock ducts and soothe the discomfort of engorgement. They may also be used as an aid to reduce post-operative swelling and discomfort following breast surgery: Please consult your doctor before purchasing for this purpose.This pack contains 2 x maternity compresses, each with its own soft fabric protective cover. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.

    <title>Nexcare ColdHot Back and Abdomen Belt S/M</title>
    <product_body>Product DescriptionNexcare Cold Hot Therapy products are gel-filled compresses with dual purpose: they can provide either flexible ice or comforting heat as a drug-free way to treat pain locally. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or freezer, or warmed up in the microwave or by placing in hot water. Choose cold therapy to treat acute injuries and relieve the pain of musculoskeletal injury (the cold will help to reduce the swelling, inflammation and pain); or heat to ease pain and reduce muscle spasm associated with chronic back pain, period pain and rheumatoid arthritis.Nexcare Cold Hot Gel Compresses are hand washable and reusable. This pack includes a simple-to-use, adjustable belt that holds the compress in place against the back or abdomen and gives light support. Simply cool or warm up your compress as per the instructions in the box, slip it into the pocket of the belt and secure the belt firmly in place. The belt is composed of several layers of fabric, including 3M&amp;#x2019;s patented Thinsulate insulation material. This helps keep the compress at a constant temperature for longer, giving you prolonged periods of pain relief before you need to re-cool or reheat it. Please note that cold therapy should be applied for a maximum of 20 minutes, before removing the compress for another 20 minutes and then reapplying. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.Nexcare, Cold Hot and Thinsulate are trademarks of 3M Company.Box ContainsHot/cold gel compressInsulation beltUser instructions</product_body>

    <title>TRADITIONAL LINO PRINTING BLOCKS MOUNTED 3.2mm GREY 200x150x3.2mm (pack of 10)</title>
    <product_body>The traditional craft of Lino cutting and printing is a popular and creative educational pastime for children and adults in schools and colleges and an enjoyable creative craft at home. Lino prints well onto most papers, card and fabric giving endless creative opportunities, the opportunity to develop new skills and an appreciation of traditional printing techniques. Students can be encouraged to make their own prints, scrapbook artefacts, greeting cards, party invitations, gift labels, posters or even great works of art! Our Lino, made especially soft for block printing, is ideal for the student and master alike. Made using natural materials such as linseed oil and wood flour, our Lino is even biodegradable. Supplied in popular sizes, this is the first choice for education, hobby and professional use, achieving rapid results without specialist material or equipment. Can be used with oil and water based inks and prints on a wide range of paper, board and fabric.</product_body>

    <title>Command Medium Antique Bronze Hooks with Strips (FC12-AB)</title>
    <product_body>Package Quantity: 1&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Style Name: BronzeProduct DescriptionGive your bits and pieces a place to live with Command Antique Bronze Hooks. These decorative metal hooks can each hold up to 1kg in weight, making them the ideal organisational solution for your home or office. They can be applied to almost any flat, clean surface. When you want to rearrange, the hooks are easily and cleanly removed without damaging the surface underneath &amp;#x2013; no cracks, holes, damaged plaster, sticky residue or stains. Want to use a hook again? Just reattach it using a new Command Adhesive Strip &amp;#x2013; each pack includes a spare, and refill packs are available. These antique-effect hooks will complement classic home d&amp;#xE9;cor perfectly. The medium-sized version is ideal for hanging coats, towels and bathrobes. Many Command fans tell us that they use this type of hook to display their Christmas wreath on the front door, as the antique finish matches the rest of their door furniture. Once January rolls around, it&amp;#x2019;s easy to take down the hook without damaging the paintwork underneath, and the hook can be used year after year with replacement adhesive strips. Command products are perfect in rented accommodation where you can&amp;#x2019;t put screws in the walls or are worried about marks and stains. They hold strongly on a whole range of surfaces including paint, wood, metal and tiles, but aren&amp;#x2019;t suitable for use on wallpapered surfaces or for hanging antiques or other valuable or irreplaceable items. When you want to take one down, grasp the hook and slide it upwards to remove it from the mounting base. The hook and mounting base can be re-used with a new adhesive strip. To remove the Command Adhesive Strip from the wall, hold the plastic base gently and pull the tab straight down, slowly stretching it until the strip releases from the wall. All of these instructions are detailed on the back of the pack. Command is a trademark of 3M Company.Box Contains1 pack, each containing 1 hook and 2 medium adhesive strips.</product_body>

    <title>Lino Cutter No 1 (Box of 5)</title>
    <product_body>No. 1 Cutter For fine lines and cross hatching. Use at a steep angle and push forward with light pressure being sure not to go deep. Never try to plunge any cutter deeper than the ground sides of the point. With practice, a line of 0.5mm (0.020&quot;) or less is possible in SoftCutTM material and a little wider in Lino. Care is needed when inking up over lines this fine as it is easy to push the ink into shallow lines with a soft brayer (lino roller).</product_body>

    <title>Safety Hand Guard</title>
    <product_body>This device is an essential safety measure in multi student environments. The natural instinct is to drive a cutting gouge towards the restraining hand holding the work piece, so wehave created a guard that covers the smallest to the more dexterous larger hand, in one item.The guard is held either at the corner of the reliefblock or on top of the carving material close to the area to be cut. Any slippage is caught in theupright walls of the guard protecting the user from harm. An ergonomic, left or right handed, one piece moulding at a price that makes itsinclusion in your tool box and school room a must.</product_body>

    <product_body>No. 1 Cutter For fine lines and cross hatching. Use at a steep angle and push forward with light pressure being sure not to go deep.

    <title>3M 60-320 Sandblaster High-Performance Grit Sandpaper P320 / Fine 230 x 280 mm Pack of 3</title>
    <product_body>When you have sanding and prep work to do, 3M offers a wide range of high performance sandpapers, flexible abrasives, sanding sponges and tools. Select the best sanding tool for the task and you will have less work on your hands, with supreme results. SandBlasterTM Sandpaper is coated with mineral and features an advanced, durable backing material that resists tearing, for a satisfying day&apos;s work. SandBlasterTM Sandpaper Fine Grit is perfect for use between coats of paint or varnish on a wide range of surfaces including emulsion, wood, metal, plastic and fibreglass. This evenly coated sandpaper resists clogging and tearing - when dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! These sheets of sandpaper can be used by hand, or with sanding blocks or orbital sanders. When compared to conventional alternatives of comparable grits, SandBlaster Sandpaper cuts up to three times faster, stays sharp and delivers a smoother, long-lasting finish. This pack contains 3 sheets of SandBlaster Sandpaper P320 Fine Grit, each ofwhich measures 230 mm x 280 mm. Choose this grade for a flawless final finish. Designed for sanding flat areas such as table tops or walls, the sheets are ideal for hand sanding or can be easily cut into smaller pieces for use with an electrical sander. To make hand sanding easier, why not try the 3M Rubber Sanding Block? Simply attach a piece of SandBlaster Sandpaper to the heavyweight block for an improved grip, extra power and better sanding control. Material: Aluminium Oxide. It is recommended that a suitable respirator and safety goggles/glasses are worn during sanding. Sanding lead based paints can be hazardous. SandBlaster Sandpaper: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.</product_body>

I&apos;ve used ear plugs of all kinds, normal ear muffs and a number of electronic ear muffs.But the Peltor Sportac Electronic&apos;s are the BEST I have ever come across. all of the other electronic models I&apos;ve used when shooting etc, tend to shut off when the shot is taken, then come back on again a second or two later. The Sportac cuts out the damaging high frequency, but still lets you hear what&apos;s going on around you.My wife and I both have a pair and we both agree that the only thing we&apos;ll be buying in the future, are replacement batteries and hygene kits.In the words of Tina Turner they&apos;re, &quot;Simply the Best&quot;, what more is there left to say ??? - Baz P, K&apos;</product_body>

The MP160 also features a flip stand intuitively built in to the base of the unit, offering a stable height adjustment, while the universal 6.35mm tripod socket allows the user to manipulate height with the 3M tripod supplied, or utilise compatible tripods and security locks.

Based on smartphone capability, the MP160 can make the small screen of your phone large and easy to show to groups. Be sure to test with your phones, as some manufacturers block content out of phones, while older devices (such as previous generations of BlackBerry) do not have a video- or TV-out and can therefore not be connected to the MP160.     The 3M PocketProjector MP160 is backed by a one-year limited warranty.

    <title>Filtrete FAPF01/02 Ultra Clean Small Air Purifier Replacement Filter - For Filtrete Air Purifier Model: FAP01 and FAP02 - 1 Filter</title>
    <product_body>Package Quantity: 1&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;Colour: WhiteProduct Description3M recommends you change the filter of your Filtrete Room Air Purifier after three months of continuous use to ensure the particles removed during filtration are not returned to the environment during cleaning, ensure the electrostatic benefits of the filter are maintained and maintain its effectiveness. Filtrete Air Purifiers are a new and intelligent solution from the name that delivers cleaner indoor air. They offer an unrivalled combination of low noise, high Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) and value for money and are up to 30% more effective than an equivalent HEPA filter. Filtrete Room Air Purifiers use patented technology that has enabled 3M to produce a less dense filter than equivalent HEPA filters. This means dramatically more air can pass through a Filtrete Room Air Purifer and the result is much quicker circulation and cleaning of the air. Most permanent and washable filters quickly lose their electrostatic properties through washing and clogging. By using replacable filters, Filtrete air purifiers deliver the enhanced filtration of a electrostatic filter on a sustained basis. Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) is a measure of an air cleaner&apos;s delivery of particle-free air and is calculated through independent laboratory tests. The CADR indicates volume of filtered air delivered by an air purifier: the higher the tobacco smoke, pollen and dust numbers, the faster the unit filters the air. Filtrete purifiers are up to 99.9% effective at removing pollen, dust mite debris and mould spores from the air and use patented filter technology that allows more air to pass through the purifier. As a result, allergens are removed more quickly.Box Contains1 x Small Air Purifier Replacement Filter</product_body>

    <product_body>Product DescriptionWith a bright, easy-to-use interface, kid-friendly app store, and durable case, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids is the ideal tablet for your kids&apos; digital playing and learning time. Preloaded with top-ranked apps for kids, the lightweight Galaxy Tab 3 Kids also features a built-in camera and parental controls for access and time limits. It transforms from kid to standard mode so you can enjoy the same familiar features as a regular Galaxy Tab 3.Interactive Kids Mode for playing and learningKids&apos; Store with fun, top-ranked appsParental controls to manage access and set time limitsDurable design withstands daily drops and spillsStandard mode offers features of regular Galaxy Tab 3Fast processor; 7-inch HD display; 8GB memoryFun and Interactive Kids Mode is Easy to UseThe Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids features a kid-centric interface with bright colours and animated characters to make playing and learning more fun for your little one. Each app appears as a card that your child can select by simply tapping. Kids can personalise their play by adding their name, choosing a character to guide them, and changing the background.The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids has a brilliant 7-inch display, with HD 1024x600 resolution, so text is clearer and colours are brighter. The powerful 1.2 GHz dual-core processor makes it ideal for downloading apps and games, and watching your favorite movies.Kids&apos; Store Full of Child-Friendly AppsSamsung&apos;s Kids&apos; Store is filled with top apps for learning and playing. The kid-friendly apps are organised by category, so your kids can browse apps based on their preferences. Instead of buying, kids add each app to a wish list that can be accessed through parental controls, letting you choose which ones to purchase.Not only will you have full control over what apps your kids buy and explore, you can also choose your own Google Play apps to add to the Kids Mode by simply checking off those apps in Application Manager. Add Skype if you want to let them video chat with Grandma, or add video apps like Netflix.Easy Camera Lets Your Kid Be the PhotographerThe built-in camera is specially designed for kids to take pictures and shoot videos. They can use the 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for silly faces, or flip it around to capture their surroundings with the 3-megapixel rear camera. Virtual stickers let them play pretend and dress up their pictures with different features and accessories. Kids Gallery and Kids Video store all their photos and videos so they can revisit their favorite shots. Parental control mode lets you access their work in your gallery and share with other relatives.Parental Controls Keep Kids SafeThe Galaxy Tab 3 Kids includes features just for parents, so you can hand over the tablet with peace of mind. A secure password entry gives you access to parental controls that let you set time restrictions on their usage, control what they view, and choose which apps you want to purchase.  Durable Case Holds Up against Drops and Spills   The drop-tested bump case is tough enough to withstand daily drops and spills. The soft cover is CPSC certified as a nontoxic material, so it&apos;s safe if your teething toddler gets hold of it. Lightweight, Compact Design for Little HandsThe lightweight, 7-inch design makes the Galaxy Tab 3 Kids ideal for little hands. It weighs less than 1lb, so it&apos;s easy for little ones to hold in their car seat or for you to carry in your purse or nappy bag.Easily Switch to Familiar Galaxy Tab 3 Home ScreenThe Galaxy Tab 3 Kids allows you to easily switch from Kids Mode to standard mode, giving you access to the same interface and features of the regular Galaxy Tab 3. Both modes can coexist, so you can switch back and forth without losing content. This makes it easy for parents to stream videos and music, read e-books, or browse up to 750,000 apps from Google Play before switching back to Kids Mode.Product InformationThis tablet comes installed with Android 4.1.2, Jelly Bean, contains a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, and has a 7-inch display with 1024x600 resolution, a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera.

    <title>Avery Dennison Prismatic High Reflective Conspicuity Tape, For Rigid Surfaces, V-6701B Euro CT Yellow, 3 metres by 50mm</title>
    <product_body>Many accidents are avoidable if the driver of the other vehicle had only been able to detect the truck. Reflective contour markings on trucks make detection easy, giving drivers time to see a vehicle, react and avoid a collision. In fact, NHTSA studies demonstrate 41 percent reduction in side and rear trailer impact when using conspicuity tape. Avery Dennison V-6700B Series Conspicuity Tape provides superior reflectivity and may help reduce accidents, prevent injuries and can decrease related costs such as repairs, insurance expenses and fees.</product_body>

    <title>Carbon Effect Cast Wrap Film from SignLine.</title>
    <product_body>A high grade of film, very nice carbon effect, gloss finish.If you bought 5000 metres of this branded, EU origin film, you would still be paying twice as much per metre than what BESTWAYTOYOU are saying they can sell it for. Fraudulent listing by BESTWAY. If you want to pass all our wealth to China buying sub standard materials then there are many (the majority) of other sellers for you. If you want High grades of branded materials of EU origin and are willing to pay the price for a clear conscience, then you are the clients we are here for and have been since 1994.If you covered the whole of China, The UK &amp; The USA with trees &amp; let them grow to maturity over 25+ years &amp;never cut them down, you wouldn&apos;t neutralise even one year&apos;s worth of pollution buying products from China.Morally &amp; ethically we cannot justify it here at SignLine regardless of any monetary savings, there is no monetary saving that justifies the destruction of the environment of our planet and all the life that it supports.Therefore we do not supply any materials manufactured in the far east from undemocratic countries, that have few human rights and absolutely no animal welfare, skinning animals like cats and dogs while they are still alive, and they remain alive afterwards too, if only for a short, painful time, or the same countries that do not have to meet all the stringent regulations and standards to protect consumers and the environment as we have to do in the UK and the rest of Europe.China accounts for 95% of all elephant poaching, slaughtered for their ivory, a recent haul in Africa of ivory bound for China contained the tusks of over 700 elephants, with all the wealth transferred to China based on their cheap prices the Chinese are now building in Africa and living there too, accelerating the demise of our planets largest land mammal and it&apos;s environment.</product_body>

    <title>Avery Dennison Conspicuity Tape, For Flexible Surfaces, V-6772 B Red</title>
    <product_body>Many accidents are avoidable if the driver of the other vehicle had only been able to detect the truck.

    <title>Avery Dennison Conspicuity Tape, For Flexible Surfaces, V-6750 B White</title>
    <product_body>Many accidents are avoidable if the driver of the other vehicle had only been able to detect the truck. Reflective contour markings on trucks make detection easy, giving drivers time to see a vehicle, react and avoid a collision. In fact, NHTSA studies demonstrate 41 percent reduction in side and rear trailer impact when using conspicuity tape. Avery Dennison V-6700B Series Conspicuity Tape provides superior reflectivity and may help reduce accidents, prevent injuries and can decrease related costs such as repairs, insurance expenses and fees.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature> Avery Dennison&reg; V-6750B Series Conspicuity Tape meets the stringent requirements of the ECE 104, Class C regulation.</feature>
      <feature> Designed for use on PVC curtain sided vehicles, V-6750B provides superior reflectivity and enhanced night time safety.</feature>
      <feature> It is a high quality, durable, microprismatic retro reflective material with a pressure sensitive adhesive.</feature>
      <feature> The single layer construction does not require edge sealing.</feature>

    <title>Pig Board, 600mm x 600mm x 10mm, White.</title>
    <product_body>Designed and produced in Norfolk by SignLine. We use our cnc router to cut these to shape, the machine is capable of cutting to any shape or font. All materials we use are of full EU origin, no Chinese rubbish here (you&apos;re barred!). Boards are easy to keep clean. They can be decorated as we did in one of the sample photo&apos;s but that would be for an additional charge. We also produce herd boards from the same materials. Pig boards are also available in 900mm x 600mm as in photo with our young lad holding one.</product_body>

    <title>Boat Wax - 3MTM ScotchgardTM Marine Protective Liquid Wax</title>
    <product_body>When your boat is on dry land, it's the perfect time to clean and compound the hull to remove oxidisation, polish for a deep gloss and then rub in a protective coating of boat wax. ScotchgardTM Marine Protective Liquid Wax has an easy-on, easy-off formula that is quick and simple to apply. Suitable for use on marine fibreglass and gel coat, marine topside paints, painted aluminium and metal parts, the liquid bonds to surfaces to create a durable protective coating that reduces UV light damage, whilst also producing a deep shine with no swirl marks. Tests show that it is 33% more durable than other leading brands after 39 days - and this long-lasting formulation means less time waxing, more time boating. This pack contains 1 x 500 ml bottle of ScotchgardTM Marine Protective Liquid Boat Wax. It can be applied by hand with a soft cloth or using a mechanical buffer. For best results, apply to small areas at a time. Whether you are restoring a boat or just trying to maintain its shine, gently navigating canals or sail boat racing, our chandlery supplies can help you achieve a high quality, professional finish quickly - leaving you more time to get out on the water.</product_body>
