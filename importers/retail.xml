    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Kitchen Duo Scourer Twin Pack (10)</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-BriteTM has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. The Scotch-BriteTM Kitchen Duo non-scratch sponge scourer makes scrubbing household surfaces quick and easy. Suitable for use all over the home, it will make light work of cleaning burnt-on food from your pots and pans or stubborn residue from the bathroom sink. The soft silver side is gentle enough for your most delicate surfaces, whilst the coloured side will cut through dirt and grease fast and effectively to leave your home gleaming. Kind to hands and comfortable to hold - even without rubber gloves - its thick inner sponge means that it is flexible enough to wrap around the contours of awkward shapes and squeeze into tight corners to make tricky cleaning jobs a doddle. Unlike traditional scouring pads, the Kitchen Duo is easy to rinse and wring out and will clean effectively for longer. Thanks to its powerful performance, you'll also find you need less chemical cleaning fluid - so it's economical and kinder to the environment too.</product_body>

    <title>Mumbles Velvet Bear (Medium, Brown)</title>
    <product_body>Mumbles bears love getting dressed up, and that's why we're pleased there's such a huge selection of clothes for us to choose from. We don't mind what we wear, because every item in our clothing range is beautifully made and designed to fit perfectly. We are made from the finest quality materials and are stringently tested, ensuring that we always comply to EN71 European Toy Safety Standards. Although we love children, we are not suitable for little ones under the age of three months because we have small parts. What makes Mumbles bears different We think that the Mumbles family is pretty special, and believe that it's the small details that make us stand out from other teddy bears on the market. We're all really happy to be a part of such a first-rate group, so you can't get rid of the grin on our distinctive faces! A smart ribbon for the undressed members of the family (Monty, Bracken, Bertie, Brumble, Otis), and well-made clothes for the ones who are pre-dressed (Honey, Benson, Binx) complete our special look we think! Why Mumbles bears are good for retail We think it's important that we can be sold separately and so to make this easier for our prospective owners, we're all individually barcoded and have smart swing tags attached to our ears. Ways to use Mumbles bears Mumbles bears are truly content little chaps and are perfect for a hundred and one different things. Happy homes that we have ended up in have included hotels (gifts left on pillows); shops (decorated with happy birthday and congratulations messages for example); sports teams (as a lucky mascot); companies (leave behinds on visits as a token of appreciation for clients). This is just a small selection of examples however - the only limit to how you can use a Mumbles bear is your imagination!</product_body>

    <title>Mumbles Velvet Bear (Medium, Cream)</title>
    <product_body>Mumbles bears love getting dressed up, and that's why we're pleased there's such a huge selection of clothes for us to choose from. We don't mind what we wear, because every item in our clothing range is beautifully made and designed to fit perfectly. We are made from the finest quality materials and are stringently tested, ensuring that we always comply to EN71 European Toy Safety Standards. Although we love children, we are not suitable for little ones under the age of three months because we have small parts. What makes Mumbles bears different We think that the Mumbles family is pretty special, and believe that it's the small details that make us stand out from other teddy bears on the market. We're all really happy to be a part of such a first-rate group, so you can't get rid of the grin on our distinctive faces! A smart ribbon for the undressed members of the family (Monty, Bracken, Bertie, Brumble, Otis), and well-made clothes for the ones who are pre-dressed (Honey, Benson, Binx) complete our special look we think! Why Mumbles bears are good for retail We think it's important that we can be sold separately and so to make this easier for our prospective owners, we're all individually barcoded and have smart swing tags attached to our ears. Ways to use Mumbles bears Mumbles bears are truly content little chaps and are perfect for a hundred and one different things. Happy homes that we have ended up in have included hotels (gifts left on pillows); shops (decorated with happy birthday and congratulations messages for example); sports teams (as a lucky mascot); companies (leave behinds on visits as a token of appreciation for clients). This is just a small selection of examples however - the only limit to how you can use a Mumbles bear is your imagination!</product_body>

    <title>Mumbles Velvet Bear (Small, Cream)</title>
    <product_body>Mumbles bears love getting dressed up, and that's why we're pleased there's such a huge selection of clothes for us to choose from. We don't mind what we wear, because every item in our clothing range is beautifully made and designed to fit perfectly. We are made from the finest quality materials and are stringently tested, ensuring that we always comply to EN71 European Toy Safety Standards. Although we love children, we are not suitable for little ones under the age of three months because we have small parts. What makes Mumbles bears different We think that the Mumbles family is pretty special, and believe that it's the small details that make us stand out from other teddy bears on the market. We're all really happy to be a part of such a first-rate group, so you can't get rid of the grin on our distinctive faces! A smart ribbon for the undressed members of the family (Monty, Bracken, Bertie, Brumble, Otis), and well-made clothes for the ones who are pre-dressed (Honey, Benson, Binx) complete our special look we think! Why Mumbles bears are good for retail We think it's important that we can be sold separately and so to make this easier for our prospective owners, we're all individually barcoded and have smart swing tags attached to our ears. Ways to use Mumbles bears Mumbles bears are truly content little chaps and are perfect for a hundred and one different things. Happy homes that we have ended up in have included hotels (gifts left on pillows); shops (decorated with happy birthday and congratulations messages for example); sports teams (as a lucky mascot); companies (leave behinds on visits as a token of appreciation for clients). This is just a small selection of examples however - the only limit to how you can use a Mumbles bear is your imagination!</product_body>

    <title>3M Aura 9332+C Particle Mask for Working with Insulation Materials and Hardwood Protection Level FFP3</title>
    <product_body>The right and convenient choice for toxic particles. The secret of the 3M Aura 9322+ particle mask is the hardly noticeable breathing resistance with reliable performance filter and the three-piece design. This allows the shallow folds of the mask on the carriage in the pocket and ease of speech while wearing. The mask is particularly pleasant on the skin, thanks to the soft inner fleece. With the use of the chin strap, it can be easily positioned and seated, thanks to the special design of the nose region. The integrated nose piece with sweat padding makes it the suitable partner for eyeglass wearers. Another comfort factor is the 3M Cool Flow valve technology, which facilitates the outflow of warm, moist air from the breathing mask and prevents heat build-up. The mask is suitable for roof insulation with insulating wool, the hard woodworking, wall and ceiling repairs. They can be folded flat and is thus practically to take along in your pocket. The product conforms to the protection level FFP3 and meets the safety requirements of the European standard EN 149: 2001 and A1: 2009 FFP3 NR D.</product_body>

It is strong and sticky, providing a reliable seal without drying out, splitting or coming unstuck. The Easy Start Dispenser unwinds the tape accurately and easily, without tangling or wrinkling, to give a smooth, secure seal in seconds. No more twisted bundles of wasted tape or nasty bits stuck in your teeth - just run the dispenser along the gap to be sealed, then angle it up to cut off the tape at the required length. The dispenser itself is small, neat and easy to store &#8211; perfect for the home or office.
This pack contains one roll of Scotch Decorative Packaging Tape printed with a pink polka dot design. The roll is 48mm wide and 12.7m long, and comes pre-loaded onto an Easy Start Dispenser. Scotch is a trademark of 3M Company.

    <title>3M Marine Cleaner and Wax</title>
    <product_body>Whether you are restoring a boat or just trying to maintain its shine, gently navigating canals or sail boat racing, our chandlery supplies can help you achieve a high quality, professional finish quickly - leaving you more time to get out on the water. When your boat is on dry land, it's the perfect time to clean and compound the hull to remove oxidisation, polish for a deep gloss and then rub in a protective coating of boat wax. 3M Marine Fibreglass Cleaner &amp; Wax is a dual action product that removes imperfections like light oxidation, rust, corrosion, chalking, fading, scratches and exhaust stains to restore shine in half the time. This unique blend of rubbing compound and waxes is suitable for use on all fibreglass, topside paints and gel coat repairs, where it leaves behind a hard coat of wax that protects surfaces from further damage caused by sunlight, salt water and pollutants. With 3M Marine Fibreglass Cleaner &amp; Wax you combine two restoration steps into one - saving you money and leaving you more time to enjoy your boat. This pack contains 1 x 500 ml bottle of 3M Marine Fibreglass Cleaner &amp; Wax. For the treatment of heavier oxidation, try 3M Marine Fibreglass Restorer &amp; Wax.</product_body>

    <product_body>Post-it Super Sticky Notes stick around as long as you need them to. Perfect for vertical and hard-to-stick-to surfaces, they are super-strong, super-adhesive, super-versatile - and super-stand-out. With a range of sizes and bright colours they really get your messages noticed.
These notes feature a strong but repositionable adhesive - they can cling to both smooth and rough surfaces and stick for longer on walls, doors, mirrors and fridges. The adhesive won't leave marks on your walls or pages, so you can stick them wherever they&#8217;ll be noticed to keep your family, colleagues &#8230; and yourself organised!
This pack contains 2 pads of star-shaped Post-it Super Sticky Notes &#8211; 1 x yellow pad and 1 x orange pad. Each pad contains 75 sheets measuring 73mm x 71mm - the perfect size for a quick reminder! Do your kids forget their lunchboxes or sports kit every morning? Why not leave them a message on the inside of the front door so they see it before they leave the house? Will your husband remember to pick up his dry cleaning on the way home? Stick a note on his laptop or briefcase so he&#8217;s got no excuse! The star shape adds a bit of fun and will really catch their attention.
For messages that really stick, get organised with Super Sticky Post-it Notes!

    <title>3MTM Microfibre Detailing Cloth, 1 Per Pack (39016) (1)</title>
    <product_body>The 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth made from super soft, non-linting microfibre that quickly and effectively removes wax residue, finger marks and even light scratches from vehicle bodywork. Easy to use, it does the hard work for you and makes completing those finishing touches a breeze and is also great with 3MTM Glass Cleaner. As with all of our products, we pride ourselves on the incredibly high quality of the 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth. Designed to be durable, hardworking and long lasting, it offers excellent value for money and comes highly recommended by automotive professionals and customers who have used it at home. If you only have one detailing cloth in your collection, this is definitely the one to choose. The 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth performs well with all of the cleaning products in the 3M Car Care Range and is the ideal accessory for cleaning, polishing and dusting inside and out. Its super soft construction won't scratch surfaces but as with any detailing cloth, be careful to use it only on clean surfaces and shake it out regularly. Any particles that it picks up could cause scratches. Step by Step 1. Fold cloth into quarters to create a flat uniform surface. Wipe surface to remove any residue and buff to a high shine with a clean section of the cloth 2. Unfold and refold the cloth frequently to expose a clean surface in order to avoid scratching by particles which may have been picked up by the cloth 3. Because of the Detail Cloth's superior dust and dirt lifting and trapping properties, frequent washing is recommended. The cloth is hot water, chlorine bleach and dryer safe. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m32pwiKv80Q</product_body>

</url>
    <title>3M Ultrathon Insect Repellent Lotion</title>
    <product_body>Ultrathon Lotion provides long lasting protection from biting insects via advanced 3M Time Release Technology, with up to 12 hour protection against mosquitoes from one application. Recommended by Ray Mears, the TV expert on bushcraft and survival, this insect repellent lotion will ensure you and your family have a high level of protection both for holidays to tropical climates and for breaks and outdoor trips closer to home. This is also the product of choice for the UK Armed Forces. Ultrathon Lotion comes in a 60 ml tube and contains 34% DEET. The Ultrathon formula contains 3M Time Release Technology, meaning the DEET is released slowly, over a longer period of time compared to conventional products. One benefit of a lower DEET content is that the product is also suitable in lower risk environments; another is a more pleasant odour for the user, since the DEET smell is not so strong. The Ultrathon formulation is also splash and sweat resistant, affording long lasting protection even when you are active, against a range of biting insects--including mosquitoes, midges, ticks, fleas, gnats and biting flies.</product_body>

    <title>White Reflexite Reflective Vehicle Tape (ECE 104) 5 Metres Long 50mm Wide</title>
    <product_body>Reflective tape designed for application onto vehicles and trailers (with rigid surfaces) to meet regulation ECE104. It is especially important for haulage companies who's vehicles travel into Europe as this has now become a legal requirement. You can use White or Yellow on the sides of a vehicle and yellow or red on the rear. Amendments to the UK Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 (RVLR) The Department for Transport has made a commitment to align RVLR with UNECE Regulation 48 and require conspicuity marking material to be fitted to new heavy goods vehicles and their trailers from 10 July 2011. DfT has completed amendments to the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989 which entered into force on 4 January 2010, detailing the requirements for conspicuity markings including optionally-fitted markings. Rear marker plates which have been mandatory on certain vehicles and trailers for some time in the UK are intended to serve the same function as conspicuity marking material, so DfT has made the decision not to mandate both. Optionally-fitted conspicuity markings. The amendments allow vehicles to be fitted with optional conspicuity markings, but where fitted they are required to conform to the relevant ECE Regulation 48 requirements. If compliant conspicuity markings are optionally-fitted to vehicles, then there is no requirement to fit rear marker plates to vehicles. However, the optional use of rear marking plates in addition to conspicuity markings will continue to be permitted. The RVLR have also being updated to require rear marker plates, when fitted optionally from the mandatory conspicuity marking implementation date of 10 July 2011, to comply with the latest technical specifications set out in UN ECE Regulation 70.01. This aligns with the latest requirements in UN ECE Regulation 48.</product_body>

Lino prints well onto most papers, card and fabric giving endless creative opportunities, the opportunity to develop new skills and an appreciation of traditional printing techniques. Students can be encouraged to make their own prints, scrapbook artefacts, greeting cards, party invitations, gift labels, posters or even great works of art! Our Lino, made especially soft for block printing, is ideal for the student and master alike. Made using natural materials such as linseed oil and wood flour, our Lino is even biodegradable. Supplied in popular sizes, this is the first choice for education, hobby and professional use, achieving rapid results without specialist material or equipment. Can be used with oil and water based inks and prints on a wide range of paper, board and fabric.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Easy Grip Scourer Non-Scratch Twin Pack (6)</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-Brite has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. When you have everyday chores around the kitchen, these all-purpose Scotch-BriteTM Non-Stick Sponge Scourers will allow you to clean quickly and efficiently, up to 50% faster than similar sponge scourers. The medium-duty scouring surface is safe to use on glass, plastic, stainless steel, copper and non-stick cookware and is comfortable to hold thanks to its easy-grip sponge backing. Once you've powered through the washing up, use the super absorbent sponge to wipe down surfaces and the sink. This scourer is suitable for use on most household surfaces, however you should exercise caution with extremely delicate, highly polished or painted surfaces as these may scratch. We recommend that before using them on a new surface you test first on an inconspicuous area and allow to dry to verify no surface damage. This pack contains 2 Scotch-Brite Easy Grip Non Scratch Sponge Scourers, which can be re-used by washing in either the dishwasher or in boiling water.</product_body>

    <title>JL AUDIO M700/5 MARINE AMP</title>
    <product_body>M700/5 5-Channel Class D Marine System Amplifier, 75 W x 4 @ 4 &#937; + 300 W x 1 @ 2 &#937; - 14.4V M700/5 Product Spotlight The M700/5 is ideal for a complete audiophile-grade, subwoofer + four satellite system, and it fits comfortably in just about any boat's weather-tight compartments. With this incredible little amplifier, you can drive two pairs of quality component speaker systems with plenty of clean power (75 W x 4 @ 4 &#937;), while also delivering a stout 300 W of power to a subwoofer system. The breakthrough that makes this much power possible in such a small chassis is our NexDTM switching design. The M700/5 includes a 12 dB / octave high-pass filter for one main channel pair, a 12 dB octave high-pass or bandpass filter for the other main channel pair, plus a variable slope low-pass filter for its subwoofer channel. All three filters offer continuously variable cutoff frequency selection from 50-500 Hz. This amplifier's filters can also be configured as a true 3-way crossover, with a low-pass filter for the subwoofer channel, a bandpass filter on Ch. 3 &amp; 4, and a high-pass filter on Ch. 1 &amp; 2. An "x10" multiplier switch on the Ch. 1 &amp; 2 high-pass filter allows its cutoff frequency to be adjusted from 50-500 Hz or 500-5000 Hz. With the addition of an HD-RLC remote level control (sold separately), the amplifier's subwoofer channel level or overall level can be directly controlled from a remote location. This marine amplifier features white and gray powder-coat finishes, a gasketed cover for the controls and stainless steel hardware for durability in the marine environment.</product_body>

The cycling feature allows you to measure time, distance and speed. With the swimming feature, you can track distance, pace and stroke rate. The activity tracker counts your steps, calories burned and distance throughout the day. The move bar alert motivates you to move when you've been sitting too long. 
Use Garmin vivoactive on its own or pair with your smart phone (Must be within 9 metres of smart phone) to gently alert you to incoming calls, emails and texts, plus notifications from social media and other mobile apps. 
Garmin vivoactive automatically syncs with your smart phone at strategic times throughout the day. The rechargeable battery lasts through all your activities with up to 3 weeks in watch/activity-tracking mode or 10 hours using GPS. Customise your watch face and features with free designs, stats widgets and apps from Connect IQ, Garmin's 3rd party app developer site.

    <title>Wurth Dry Chain Lube - TRIPPLE PACK!!! - Huge savings.</title>
    <product_body>Wurth's continued success is from a commitment to only supplying products of the absolute highest possible quality. Before a product is brought into the range it is subject to rigorous quality checks. Spot checks on their product range ensure that standards do not slip. Wurth dry chain lube is a unique high performance product. Engineered to penetrate the tightest gaps and linkages to ensure total coverage of the hard wearing lubrication is coated onto all surfaces. Unlike other chain lubes, Dry Chain Lube once applied leaves no sticky or flingy residue, it's `low build` technology prevents dirt, grit and general road grime from sticking to the chain thus increasing chain and sprocket life! Recommended Application - Suitable for all standard and high performance O-Ring, X-Ring and Z-Ring chains on standard and high performance motorbikes</product_body>

    <title>OpticludeTM Boys &amp; Girls Orthoptic Eye Patches - Maxi Size Pack 30 Coloured Patches</title>
    <product_body>During the first four months of a child's life the visual pathways develop as the eye matures and receives images which are then sent to the brain. For correct development of vision the brain needs to receive equally clear and focused images from both eyes at the same time. However, if anything interferes with this development, it can result in amblyopia and reduced vision. Amblyopia is a condition that only children develop and needs to be treated in the early years in order to be corrected. The use of an eye patch - or occlusion therapy - to cover your child's stronger eye will encourage their weaker eye to start working and stimulate vision, hence helping the part of the brain that manages sight to further develop. The length of time and the number of hours per day that your child is required to wear the patch varies, so it is important to follow the specific treatment routine that is prescribed. OpticludeTM Boys &amp; Girls Eye Patches are tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe to provide a comfortable solution to childhood amblyopia. Our Eye Patches are specially designed for children, featuring different sizes, pictures and colours to brighten up their day - and yours! This pack contains 30 oval maxi Patches, measuring 5.7cm x 8cm, in 3 different colourful patterns. They have a central pad which absorbs excess moisture and are made from a breathable, hypoallergenic and latex-free material. Easy to apply and remove, now you can make patching a pleasure. N.B.: Occlusion therapy should only be conducted under the guidance of an orthoptist or other suitably qualified healthcare professional. This product should only be used as advised by an ophthalmologist.</product_body>

    <title>Command Medium Antique Bronze Hooks with Strips (FC12-AB)</title>
    <product_body>Give your bits and pieces a place to live with Command Antique Bronze Hooks. These decorative metal hooks can each hold up to 1kg in weight, making them the ideal organisational solution for your home or office. They can be applied to almost any flat, clean surface. When you want to rearrange, the hooks are easily and cleanly removed without damaging the surface underneath &#8211; no cracks, holes, damaged plaster, sticky residue or stains. Want to use a hook again? Just reattach it using a new Command Adhesive Strip &#8211; each pack includes a spare, and refill packs are available. 
These antique-effect hooks will complement classic home d&#233;cor perfectly. The medium-sized version is ideal for hanging coats, towels and bathrobes. Many Command fans tell us that they use this type of hook to display their Christmas wreath on the front door, as the antique finish matches the rest of their door furniture. Once January rolls around, it&#8217;s easy to take down the hook without damaging the paintwork underneath, and the hook can be used year after year with replacement adhesive strips. 
Command products are perfect in rented accommodation where you can&#8217;t put screws in the walls or are worried about marks and stains. They hold strongly on a whole range of surfaces including paint, wood, metal and tiles, but aren&#8217;t suitable for use on wallpapered surfaces or for hanging antiques or other valuable or irreplaceable items. When you want to take one down, grasp the hook and slide it upwards to remove it from the mounting base. The hook and mounting base can be re-used with a new adhesive strip. To remove the Command Adhesive Strip from the wall, hold the plastic base gently and pull the tab straight down, slowly stretching it until the strip releases from the wall. All of these instructions are detailed on the back of the pack. 
Command is a trademark of 3M Company.</product_body>

    <title>3M Littmann White Light Optics Otoscope</title>
    <product_body>The 3M Littmann White Light Optics Otoscope delivers Littmann quality, design, and advanced LED technology. Low-reflection, bright and white light - aids more efficient diagnosis in comparison with halogen or xenon bulbs.

</url>
    <title>Scotch Super Glue Pen (505569) - 2g</title>
    <product_body>The Scotch Super Glue Pen contains 2g of advanced formula super glue designed for bonding a wide variety of non-porous materials including wood, metal, some plastics, ceramic and more. Dispensed through a fine, push-point tip, it is ideal for precision tasks requiring only a small amount of glue. The pen is extremely easy to use and gives ultimate control over the amount of glue released onto the surface of your item &#8211; meaning less mess, a neater finish and reduced wastage. What&#8217;s more, the tip of the pen resists clogging, sucking excess glue back down to prevent it from drying out, blocking up and rendering the remainder unusable. Once you have finished the job in hand, simply wipe the pen tip with a cloth or tissue, replace the cap and push it on tightly. Store your Scotch Super Glue Pen with the tip upwards in a cool, dry place and you&#8217;ll find you can use it over and over again.
This pack contains 1 Scotch Super Glue Pen. Please note that Scotch Super Glue is not suitable for use on polystyrene foam, foam rubber, polyethylene and polypropylene. Follow the directions for use on the back of the pack carefully.

    <title>Scotch Super Glue Liquid in a Precision Applicator (SGAD-874) - 4g</title>
    <product_body>Scotch Super Glue Liquid is advanced formula super glue that bonds securely to wood, metal, some plastics, ceramic and more. What sets it apart from the rest is the patented droplet control technology incorporated into its precision applicator &#8211; meaning you get up to 60% less mess compared to traditional metal tube super glue liquids. It is ideal for fiddly tasks where precision is essential, accurately dispensing one drop of glue at a time right where you need it. You&#8217;re far less likely to end up gluing your fingers together, or sticking something to the workbench or table!
With the Scotch Super Glue Precision Applicator, you&#8217;ll also cut down on wastage. This &#8220;stay fresh&#8221;, clog-resistant bottle sucks excess liquid back down from the opening to prevent it from drying out, blocking up the top and rendering the remainder unusable. Once you have finished the job in hand, simply wipe the applicator tip with a cloth or tissue, replace the cap and screw it on tightly. Store your bottle of Scotch Super Glue Liquid with the tip upwards in a cool, dry place and you&#8217;ll find you can use it over and over again.
Please note that Scotch Super Glue Liquid is not suitable for use on polystyrene foam, foam rubber, polyethylene and polypropylene. Follow the directions for use on the back of the pack carefully.

    <product_body>The traditional craft of Lino cutting and printing is a popular and creative educational pastime for children and adults in schools and colleges and an enjoyable creative craft at home. Lino prints well onto most papers, card and fabric giving endless creative opportunities, the opportunity to develop new skills and an appreciation of traditional printing techniques. Students can be encouraged to make their own prints, scrapbook artefacts, greeting cards, party invitations, gift labels, posters or even great works of art! Our Lino, made especially soft for block printing, is ideal for the student and master alike. Made using natural materials such as linseed oil and wood flour, our Lino is even biodegradable. Supplied in popular sizes, this is the first choice for education, hobby and professional use, achieving rapid results without specialist material or equipment. Can be used with oil and water based inks and prints on a wide range of paper, board and fabric.</product_body>

</url>
    <title>Watercolour Paper Stretcher Half Imperial</title>
    <product_body>Ideal for watercolour classes. Stretch your watercolour paper with ease - No more gum strip! This infallible device takes the chore out of stretching watercolour paper of all weights. You will never need to buy brown paper tape again! All who have attempted watercolour painting will know the frustration of painting on un-stretched paper...even the heaviest papers can cockle and buckle under a wash, causing the paint to flow unevenly and ruining your work. Let's face it...watercolour painting can be difficult enough, so anything which makes it technically easier has to be a bonus. The cure is to pre-stretch your paper. Normally this means soaking the paper and then sticking it to your drawing board with pins or old-fashioned brown-paper tape, both very haphazard methods. Get the paper too wet and it can tear as it dries or even break the board. Get the tape too wet and it won't stick at all! Furthermore you have to let the paper dry naturally which can take several hours. As a watercolour teacher the inventor of this system needed a reliable device to stretch several sheets a day quickly and effortlessly, hence this invention. No tape, No clips, No fuss.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature>Made in the UK.</feature>
      <feature>No need for gummed tape.</feature>
      <feature>Perfectly flat paper every time.</feature>
      <feature>Waterproof, mould resistant board, lightweight, easy for travel.</feature>
      <feature>Quick and simple to use, again and again, cost effective and durable.</feature>

    <title>Watercolour Paper Stretcher (A3) 297mm x 420mm</title>
    <product_body>Ideal for watercolour classes. Stretch your watercolour paper with ease - No more gum strip! This infallible device takes the chore out of stretching watercolour paper of all weights. You will never need to buy brown paper tape again! All who have attempted watercolour painting will know the frustration of painting on un-stretched paper...even the heaviest papers can cockle and buckle under a wash, causing the paint to flow unevenly and ruining your work. Let's face it...watercolour painting can be difficult enough, so anything which makes it technically easier has to be a bonus. The cure is to pre-stretch your paper. Normally this means soaking the paper and then sticking it to your drawing board with pins or old-fashioned brown-paper tape, both very haphazard methods. Get the paper too wet and it can tear as it dries or even break the board. Get the tape too wet and it won't stick at all! Furthermore you have to let the paper dry naturally which can take several hours. As a watercolour teacher the inventor of this system needed a reliable device to stretch several sheets a day quickly and effortlessly, hence this invention. No tape, No clips, No fuss.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature>Made in the UK.</feature>
      <feature>No need for gummed tape.</feature>
      <feature>Perfectly flat paper every time.</feature>

    <title>3MTM NexcareTM Maternity Support For Pregnancy (Medium)</title>
    <product_body>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9AO7yXs8V4 3MTM Maternity Band - Providing Comfort and Support During Pregnancy As your baby develops in pregnancy, your tummy grows and may start to feel heavy. You might feel more tired and may even experience aches and pains in your abdomen and back. The NexcareTM Maternity Support is a latex-free, elasticated support belt that can help to ease some of the physical discomfort associated with pregnancy. It provides gentle but firm support underneath your bump to lift the extra weight, relieve pelvic girdle pain and reduce pressure on the lower back. Fully adjustable with an easy-to-use Velcro fastening, the Nexcare Maternity Support grows with your bump. Tension and support can be altered by simply stretching the belt a little more or less and adjusting the fastening position. This support can be used throughout pregnancy, but is particularly effective in the second trimester or for relatively smaller bumps. All parts of the Nexcare Maternity Support can be hand washed in cold or warm water with mild detergent. Not suitable for machine washing or tumble drying. The Medium size suits pre-pregnancy dress size 10 - 18. The Large size Large Suits pre-pregnancy dress size 18-28. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.</product_body>

It is easy to apply - by hand or using a mechanical buffer - and easy to clean up. This pack contains 1 x 950 ml bottle of 3M Marine ImperialTM Compound &amp; Finishing Material.

    <title>3MTM Stainless Steel Cleaner - Aerosol Can</title>
    <product_body>When you have steel or metal surfaces that need a deep clean and a brilliant streak-free shine, polish up your act with 3M Stainless Steel Cleaner &amp; Polish. With a pleasant citrus aroma, this high performance product cleans, polishes and restores a glossy sheen to stainless steel and other metal surfaces. Once applied, it leaves behind a light, protective film that restores sheen, helps to hide blemishes and resists fingerprints and streaking. Safe to use in food preparation areas, it is ideal for commercial kitchens and food processing areas. Other applications include cleaning and polishing architectural metal components such as elevators, escalators and hand rails; drinking water fountain backsplashes; and restaurant and food processing equipment. Unlike some chemical cleaning fluids, 3M Stainless Steel Cleaner &amp; Polish is solvent-free, water-based and non-flammable with a pleasant citrus fragrance. A little goes a long way, clinging to the surface with a small spray pattern that reduces waste. This product is suitable for use on stainless steel, chrome, aluminium, laminated plastics, enamel, Plexiglas and ceramics. For best results, use with a Scotch-BriteTM Microfibre Cleaning Cloth. This pack contains 1 aerosol can containing 600 ml of 3M Stainless Steel Cleaner &amp; Polish. Scotch-Brite Microfibre Cleaning Cloths sold separately.</product_body>

    <title>Opticlude Orthoptic Eye Patches, Size 5.7 x 8.2 cm, 20 Pack</title>
    <product_body>Tried, proven and trusted through years of use by orthoptists across Europe, Opticlude eye patches provide a comfortable solution to a sensitive problem. 3M Opticlude Orthoptic Eye Patches are used for treating childhood strabismus and amblyopia, more commonly referred to as "lazy eye". Worn over the preferred eye, the eye patch encourages the weaker eye to function. Featuring a hypoallergenic 3M Micropore Tape backing, Opticlude eye patches can be applied and removed easily with minimal skin trauma, whilst the unique pressure sensitive adhesive secures the patch throughout the occlusion period. The non-adherent pad is absorbent and prevents lacrimal secretions adhering the pad to the surrounding skin, whilst the Micropore tape backing allows the skin to breathe normally. In addition the thin lightweight design needs no shaping, folding or cutting.</product_body>

    <title>3M P60 SandBlaster Coarse Dual Angle Sanding Sponge for Paint Stripping - (Pack of 1)</title>
    <product_body>This SandBlaster Dual Angle Sanding Sponge in coarse P60 grit is the ideal choice for challenging tasks such as removing layers of old paint or varnish, or eliminating ingrained marks and blemishes from wood and metal. It is designed for use on detailed surfaces or tricky angles, where you need greater conformability or a sharper angled product. The sponge is easy and comfortable to hold, as well as flexible enough to get into those awkward, hard-to-reach corners. It can be used either wet or dry, and is washable and reusable.
When you are faced with the task of stripping old paint, SandBlaster abrasives can make the job of sanding less work, whilst providing superior quality results. They can be used on a wide range of surfaces including wood, metal, plastic, filler and fibreglass, and have a special coating to resist clogging. When dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! The SandBlaster Dual Angle Sanding Sponge is made of durable, washable foam that is coated evenly with mineral: the result is a long-lasting, reusable sanding sponge that cuts up to three times faster and delivers a more consistent finish when compared to conventional abrasives of comparable grits.
The pack supplied here contains a single 3M SandBlaster Dual Angle Sanding Sponge that measures 118mm x 82mm x 27mm and is coated with coarse P60 grit aluminium oxide mineral.
SandBlaster Sanding Sponge: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Flat Scourer, 3 Pads in Each Pack (1 Pack)</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-Brite has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Flat Scourer pads are stubborn and resilient - just like the grease or residue they will tackle, with minimum effort! Tough on grime and dirt, these large and ultra-flexible pads provide unrivalled scouring power but are flexible enough to grip contours and get right into tight corners. Whether it's crusty casserole dishes or greasy grills, they are tough enough to clean the grimiest of your kitchen cookware, hob or oven components. They are also ideal for cleaning garden tools - removing soil and corrosion to help restore your equipment and keep it in good working order. This pack contains 3 Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Flat Scourer Pads. Please note that these pads are highly effective scouring tools that are not recommended for cleaning glass, plastic, porcelain, non-stick cookware or polished, brushed or satin-finished surfaces.</product_body>

    <title>3M SandBlaster 02580UK Coarse P80 115mm x 2.5m Sandpaper Roll with Paint Stripping</title>
    <product_body>When you are faced with the task of stripping old paint, SandBlaster abrasives can make the job of sanding less work, whilst providing superior quality results. The 2.5m roll is compact and great for tool boxes: it&#8217;s easy to cut or tear pieces off for hand sanding or use with an electrical sander. Sandblaster can be used on a wide range of surfaces including wood, metal, plastic, filler and fibreglass, and has a special coating to resist clogging. When dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! SandBlaster Sandpaper is coated evenly with mineral and features an advanced backing material that resists tearing: the result is a long-lasting, durable sandpaper that cuts up to three times faster, stays sharp and delivers a more consistent finish when compared to conventional alternatives of comparable grits.
SandBlaster Sandpaper in coarse P80 grit is the ideal choice for challenging tasks such as removing layers of old paint or varnish, or eliminating ingrained marks and blemishes from wood and metal. This pack contains 1 roll of long-lasting sandpaper which measures 115mm wide x 2.5m long. To make hand sanding easier, why not try the 3M Rubber Sanding Block? Simply attach a piece of Sandblaster Sandpaper to the heavyweight block for an improved grip, extra power and better sanding control.
SandBlaster Sandpaper: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.
SandBlaster is a trademark of 3M Company.

    <product_body>Whether you are restoring a boat or just trying to maintain its shine, gently navigating canals or sail boat racing, our chandlery supplies can help you achieve a high quality, professional finish quickly - leaving you more time to get out on the water. When your boat is on dry land, it's the perfect time to clean and compound the hull to remove oxidisation, polish for a deep gloss and then rub in a protective coating of boat wax. 3M Marine Fibreglass Cleaner &amp; Wax is a dual action product that removes imperfections like light oxidation, rust, corrosion, chalking, fading, scratches and exhaust stains to restore shine in half the time. This unique blend of rubbing compound and waxes is suitable for use on all fibreglass, topside paints and gel coat repairs, where it leaves behind a hard coat of wax that protects surfaces from further damage caused by sunlight, salt water and pollutants. With 3M Marine Fibreglass Cleaner &amp; Wax you combine two restoration steps into one - saving you money and leaving you more time to enjoy your boat. This pack contains 1 x 1 litre bottle of 3M Marine Fibreglass Cleaner &amp; Wax. For the treatment of heavier oxidation, try 3M Marine Fibreglass Restorer &amp; Wax.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Scourers With Nailsaver Design 2 Packs of 2 Pads</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-Brite has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. When you need to shift stubborn grease or burnt-on food, Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Scourers With Nailsaver Design will quickly scour and clean, working up to 50% faster than similar sponge scourers and with twice the efficiency. Their easy-grip design makes them comfortable to hold, whilst their coarse scouring surface makes cleaning a breeze. For worry-free washing up, these pads have a unique design which protects your nails, reducing the need for gloves and the likelihood of broken nails. Once you've powered through the pots, use the super absorbent sponge to wipe down surfaces and the sink. Thanks to their heavy duty cleaning power, these scourers are not suitable for non-stick, delicate or highly polished surfaces. This pack contains 2 Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scourers with Nailsaver Design, which can be re-used by washing in either the dishwasher or in boiling water. We recommend that before using them on a new surface you test first on an inconspicuous area and allow to dry to verify no surface damage.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Sponge with Scourer 16 Pack</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-Brite has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. When you need to shift stubborn grease or burnt-on food, Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Sponge Scourers will quickly scour and clean - more effectively than synthetic sponge scourers and with twice the efficiency. Once you've powered through the washing up, use the super absorbent sponge to wipe down surfaces and the sink. Thanks to their heavy duty cleaning power, these scourers are not suitable for non-stick, delicate or highly polished surfaces. This pack contains 16 Heavy Duty Sponge Scourers, which can be re-used by washing in either the dishwasher or in boiling water. We recommend that before using them on a new surface you test first on an inconspicuous area and allow to dry to verify no surface damage.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch Quick Dry Tacky Adhesive, 59ml</title>
    <product_body>Every home needs some tacky, fast glue in its craft supplies, and fans of the Scotch Brand Arts &amp; Craft Range tell us that this versatile adhesive is hard to beat! 
Super strong and fast-drying, Scotch Quick Dry Tacky Adhesive is supplied in a tube with a narrow-tipped applicator that produces a fine, controlled stream of glue. This makes it ideal for detailed or precise crafts like card-making, where you can rely on it to hold fast despite repeated handling. Its thicker consistency means it will not wrinkle paper or seep under edges when pressing two surfaces together; it stays exactly where you apply it without creating messy &#8220;strings&#8221;; and it won&#8217;t run. It&#8217;s also strong enough to perform on trickier surfaces and hard-to-attach items such as fabric, ribbons and decorative embellishments. Because it dries so quickly, you&#8217;ll find that you only need to hold things in place for a few seconds before they are secure. 
In fact, it&#8217;s a great option for any project or repair where you&#8217;re short of time and can&#8217;t wait around for adhesive to dry. Here&#8217;s a top tip for parents &#8211; do your children sometimes wait until the very last minute before telling you about homework projects? Scotch Quick Dry Tacky Adhesive dries on paper in less than 5 minutes and on other materials in up to 30 minutes. Next time you need to create a model of the solar system before breakfast, this fast glue could be just the thing! 
The tube in this pack contains 59ml of glue. Check out the rest of the Scotch Brand Arts &amp; Craft Range &#8211; there&#8217;s something to help you get great results in all your favourite crafts!

    <title>Post-it Table Top Meeting Chart 563R - 20 Self-Adhesive Sheets 508 x 584mm</title>
    <product_body>Flipcharts with a difference! Get real action from your meetings by keeping all your charts visible all of the time. 
A Post-it Meeting Chart makes it easy to make your point, capture ideas or solve problems in group discussions. These meeting room essentials feature a Post-it Super Sticky adhesive strip along the top of every sheet so you can stick and reposition them around the room. They are ideal for training courses, brainstorming activities, meetings and presentations. Jot down thoughts, ideas, action points, checklists, agendas and minutes, then peel off the page and stick it to the wall for everyone to see whilst you continue on to the next sheet. You won&#8217;t need to worry about finding tape, drawing pins or adhesive putty. At the end of your meeting, simply peel off the used sheets to leave the room in exactly the same condition as when you started.
Post-it Super Sticky Meeting Charts are made from premium plain white paper with a special coating that eliminates marker bleed-through, meaning that you can write on them on the pad or on the wall without the risk of staining the underlying pages or your wall surface. They pull off the pad easily with no awkward backing paper to remove, and have the holding power to stick securely to most vertical surfaces. When your meeting is over, they remove cleanly without tearing, enabling you to take them back to your desk ready to write up your notes.
This pack contains 1 pad of Post-it Super Sticky Meeting Charts. Each flipchart pad measures 51cm x 69cm and contains 20 sheets. The pads have been conveniently designed to fold out into a self-contained easel that can be used on a table top &#8211; perfect for smaller spaces, or occasions where you need to carry the pad from room to room.

    <title>Post-it Super Sticky 50.8mm x 50.8mm Full Adhesive Notes Pad - Assorted Colours (Pack of 8, 25 Notes Per Pad)</title>
    <product_body>For over 30 years, Post-it Notes have given us a clear, simple and effective way to make a note, send a message or leave a reminder. They have helped us communicate, kept us organised and made life easier at home and in the office. With Post-it Full Adhesive Notes, you&#8217;ll find a host of new uses for them - whether you&#8217;re busy keeping your family on a hectic schedule, staying organised in the office, or working on the go.
Post-it Full Adhesive Notes have a larger area of Super Sticky adhesive that covers all but one edge of each sheet &#8211; meaning they have more holding power and stay put for longer, whilst still removing cleanly when required. The two rounded corners on the non-adhesive edge are less likely to curl or become dog-eared over time, and make it quick and easy to find and peel each sheet off the pad. The result is a note that sticks securely and lies flat for a more reliable hold and a neat, professional look.
Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are the ideal solution for high traffic areas or items that are handled frequently, such as long term project documents, instruction manuals and operating procedures. Their increased holding power means they stick better to walls, doors, fridges, purses and briefcases so you can be sure that your message gets through. Organising on the move? The pads hold securely inside folders, diaries, notebooks and portfolios, and this smaller size will fit perfectly on the back of a smartphone or inside a wallet. Simply peel away the last two sheets from the pad and stick it anywhere you might need a note &#8211; great when you&#8217;re working on the train or with clients, hot-desking, or just packing a lot into your day! Mobile, versatile and reliable: with Post-it Full Adhesive Notes you&#8217;ll always have a note within reach, wherever you are.
This pack contains 8 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes in assorted colours. Each pad measures 50.8mm x 50.8mm and contains 25 notes. Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are also available in a larger size.

    <title>Post-it Super Sticky 76mm x 76mm Full Adhesive Notes Pad - Assorted Colours (Pack of 4, 25 Notes Per Pad)</title>
    <product_body>For over 30 years, Post-it Notes have given us a clear, simple and effective way to make a note, send a message or leave a reminder. They have helped us communicate, kept us organised and made life easier at home and in the office. With Post-it Full Adhesive Notes, you&#8217;ll find a host of new uses for them - whether you&#8217;re busy keeping your family on a hectic schedule, staying organised in the office, or working on the go.
Post-it Full Adhesive Notes have a larger area of Super Sticky adhesive that covers all but one edge of each sheet &#8211; meaning they have more holding power and stay put for longer, whilst still removing cleanly when required. The two rounded corners on the non-adhesive edge are less likely to curl or become dog-eared over time, and make it quick and easy to find and peel each sheet off the pad. The result is a note that sticks securely and lies flat for a more reliable hold and a neat, professional look.
Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are the ideal solution for high traffic areas or items that are handled frequently, such as long term project documents, instruction manuals and operating procedures. Their increased holding power means they stick better to walls, doors, fridges, purses and briefcases so you can be sure that your message gets through. Organising on the move? These pads hold securely inside folders, diaries, notebooks and portfolios. Simply peel away the last two sheets from the pad and stick it anywhere you might need a note &#8211; great when you&#8217;re working on the train or with clients, hot-desking, or just packing a lot into your day! Mobile, versatile and reliable: with Post-it Full Adhesive Notes you&#8217;ll always have a note within reach, wherever you are.
This pack contains 4 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes in assorted colours. Each pad measures 76mm x 76mm and contains 25 notes. Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are also available in a smaller size.
Post-it is a trademark of 3M Company.

    <title>Post-it Super Sticky 76 x 76mm Adhesive Notes Pad - Assorted Colours (Pack of 2, 25 Notes Per Pad)</title>
    <product_body>For over 30 years, Post-it Notes have given us a clear, simple and effective way to make a note, send a message or leave a reminder. They have helped us communicate, kept us organised and made life easier at home and in the office. With Post-it Full Adhesive Notes, you&#8217;ll find a host of new uses for them - whether you&#8217;re busy keeping your family on a hectic schedule, staying organised in the office, or working on the go.
Post-it Full Adhesive Notes have a larger area of Super Sticky adhesive that covers all but one edge of each sheet &#8211; meaning they have more holding power and stay put for longer, whilst still removing cleanly when required. The two rounded corners on the non-adhesive edge are less likely to curl or become dog-eared over time, and make it quick and easy to find and peel each sheet off the pad. The result is a note that sticks securely and lies flat for a more reliable hold and a neat, professional look.
Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are the ideal solution for high traffic areas or items that are handled frequently, such as long term project documents, instruction manuals and operating procedures. Their increased holding power means they stick better to walls, doors, fridges, purses and briefcases so you can be sure that your message gets through. Organising on the move? These pads hold securely inside folders, diaries, notebooks and portfolios. Simply peel away the last two sheets from the pad and stick it anywhere you might need a note &#8211; great when you&#8217;re working on the train or with clients, hot-desking, or just packing a lot into your day! Mobile, versatile and reliable: with Post-it Full Adhesive Notes you&#8217;ll always have a note within reach, wherever you are.
This trial pack contains 2 pads of Post-it Full Adhesive Notes in assorted colours. Each pad measures 76mm x 76mm and contains 25 notes. Post-it Full Adhesive Notes are also available in packs of 4 pads (76mm x 76mm) or 8 pads (50.8mm x 50.8mm).

</url>
    <title>3M 230mm x 280mm Wetordry Sandpaper Sheets Assorted Grits - (Pack of 1)</title>
    <product_body>3M Wetordry Sandpaper is a high quality abrasive paper that is ideal for sanding between coats, fine finishing or polishing metal, varnish and painted surfaces. The silicon carbide mineral is bonded to its backing paper with waterproof resin, meaning that it can be used wet to reduce heat build-up and dust levels. If the paper becomes clogged, simply rinse it in clean water and re-use. The result is wet and dry sandpaper that gives an improved rate of cut, increased life, flexibility and a uniform, consistent finish.
The pack supplied here contains an assortment of fine grades to give you a range of choices for different applications or stages of your project. Inside the pack are 4 sheets measuring 230mm x 280mm: 1 x P240 (fine), 2 x P400 (very fine), 1 x P600 (ultra fine). 3M Wetordry Sandpaper can be used on metal, varnish and painted surfaces. Applications include sanding metal surfaces prior to applying primer or paint; sanding between coats of paint or varnish; fine finishing; polishing; burnishing old finishes and feathering fine edges.
 3M and Wetordry are trademarks of 3M Company.

    <title>3M P600 230mm x 280mm Wetordry Ultra Fine Sandpaper Sheets - (Pack of 1)</title>
    <product_body>3M Wetordry Sandpaper is a high quality abrasive paper that is ideal for sanding between coats, fine finishing or polishing metal, varnish and painted surfaces. The silicon carbide mineral is bonded to its backing paper with waterproof resin, meaning that it can be used wet to reduce heat build-up and dust levels. If the paper becomes clogged, simply rinse it in clean water and re-use. The result is wetordry sandpaper that gives an improved rate of cut, increased life, flexibility and a uniform, consistent finish.
The pack supplied here contains 4 sheets of Ultra Fine P600 grit Wetordry Sandpaper &#8211; ideal for fine finishing, polishing car bodywork and achieving an ultra smooth surface. Each sheet measures 230mm x 280mm. 3M Wetordry Sandpaper can be used on metal, varnish and painted surfaces. Applications include sanding metal surfaces prior to applying primer or paint; sanding between coats of paint or varnish; fine finishing; polishing; burnishing old finishes and feathering fine edges.

    <product_body>Sitting at a desk for long periods can take its toll, causing aches and pains that affect your health and impact on your productivity. Arranging your physical workspace correctly can go a long way towards resolving these issues, enabling you to work comfortably and effectively throughout the day.
The 3M FR530 Adjustable Foot Rest can help to reduce strain and fatigue on the legs, back and neck by helping you achieve an ergonomically correct posture whilst sitting at your desk. Its extra-wide platform provides plenty of space for both feet and is large enough to allow you to shift position comfortably. The tilt is easily adjusted and controlled through pressure with the feet; the height of the platform can also be altered if required.
With its sturdy, heavy duty steel construction, this foot rest will significantly outlast its plastic equivalents and comes with a 5 year warranty. It is heavy enough to stay put, even on carpet, and is covered with 3M Safety Walk textured, slip-resistant material that is comfortable underfoot yet prevents feet from sliding - even if you like to work barefoot or in your socks! There is no self-assembly required &#8211; set up is as easy as opening the box, positioning it under your desk and using your feet to set it to the perfect angle.
3M and Safety Walk are trademarks of 3M Company.

    <title>FiltreteTM Ultra Clean Replacement Filter, Box of 4 Large, FAPF-03</title>
    <product_body>Replacement Filter For FiltreteTM Ultra Clean Room Air Purifier Large - FAP-03 This replacement air purifier filter is suitable for the FiltreteTM Ultra Clean Room Air Purifier Large (FAP-03). Thanks to the quality materials and high filtering performance of this product, it is simply the best when it comes to filters for air purifier humidifiers. As well as boasting a 99.9% removal rate when it comes to pollen, dust mite debris and mould spores, this FiltreteTM Ultra Clean Replacement Filter also offers an unrivalled combination of low noise, high clean air delivery rates and value for money. The filter works by effectively capturing particles that are commonly found around the home including dust, pet dander, cigarette smoke, other smoke and even particles that carry odours and viruses. Securely trapped in the filter, these disruptive particles are no longer floating around the house which means that any potential causes of discomfort - which may result in breathing difficulties, itchy eyes, irritated skin and many of the other symptoms of allergies - are eliminated. With an allergy UK seal of approval when used in conjunction with FiltreteTM Air Purifiers, this product can effectively help to alleviate the symptoms of allergies and hay fever or simply provide a cleaner living environment. * 99.9% effective at removing particles from the air which passes through the purifier. 3M Recommends filter change after 3 months of continuous use: To ensure particles removed during filtration are not returned to the environment during cleaning. To ensure the electrostatic benefits of the filter are maintained; that's why washing the filters wouldn't work. Replacing the filter is important for maintaining the effectiveness of your FiltreteTM Room Air Purifier</product_body>

    <title>Scotch Book Repair Tape, 50.8mm x 13.7m, 1 roll</title>
    <product_body>Trust Scotch Book Repair Tape to help you mend books, magazines, folders and more, giving you many more years of enjoyment. 
This tough, crystal clear, self-adhesive tape is strong and reliable - perfect for use at home, in the office and at school. Use it to repair or reinforce the spine, edges, covers and pages of books, magazines, journals, binders and even record sleeves, preserving your most useful and treasured items for years to come. Pliable and conformable, this tape will adhere to even the most awkward corners and folds to give a secure, long-lasting seal that flexes with cover or page movements. The acid-free adhesive is safe to use on photographs and sensitive papers, and will not yellow, dry out or split over time. 
Scotch Book Repair Tape is great for those favourite paperbacks that you come back to time and again, or lend out to friends, only for the cover to start to separate or pages come loose. Use this tape along the length of the spine and fold it around to protect the seam that joins the front and back covers. Run lengths of tape inside the spine to reattach loose pages, and even to repair ones that may have torn. Children&#8217;s books are notoriously difficult to keep in a good condition, but Scotch Book Repair Tape will help you mend their all-time favourites, and reinforce the corners and edges of new purchases to make them sturdier. Because the tape is so clear, you could also use it to fix labels to the spines of your books, folders and binders &#8211; great for the office, libraries, nurseries, schools, students and the super-organised! 
Scotch Book Repair Tape is easy to use. It unwinds smoothly and gives you the chance to position and reposition the strip carefully before pressing down to seal it permanently. This pack contains 1 roll of Scotch Book Repair Tape, measuring 50.8mm wide by 13.7m long.

    <title>Scotch&#174; Filament Packing Tape 8915 Blue, 24mm x 55m</title>
    <product_body>Our super-resilient Scotch&#174; Filament Packing Tape is reinforced with single-direction glass filaments to ensure that once it's in place, whatever you've stuck or bundled together won't budge. Great for packing, repairing or DIY, our durable, reliable tape can be used in both the home and office. Scotch Filament Packing Tape will not stretch along its length, so you can be sure it will hold even large, heavy items exactly where you place them - ideal for DIY and repairs. It can also be used to keep tools and items securely together in the shed or store room, preventing items falling out when you open the door. You'll also find our tape invaluable during house and office moves. It can be used for keeping loose items together - such as computers with their accessories - or to keep drawers and cupboard doors from opening in transit. When it's time to remove the tape, it will leave no adhesive residue behind, even on PVC or stainless steel surfaces. Make daily tasks easier with Scotch - the high-quality, high-performance brand you can trust.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch GiftWrap Tape, Dispensered Roll 19mm x 16.5m - 1 roll</title>
    <product_body>When you have taken the time to choose a special gift, make your present look perfect with Scotch GiftWrap Tape. It features a unique satin finish that has low reflectivity and almost disappears on most gift wrap papers for a seamless join and professional finish. It is quick and easy to unwind and cut using the child-friendly plastic dispenser supplied, and sticks securely to ensure your presents remain under wraps! 
Whilst designed to perform on gift wrap papers, Scotch GiftWrap Tape can also come in handy at home and school for general mending, sealing, mounting and craft activities where you need a discreet finish. The adhesive is photo safe and long-ageing: it won&#8217;t damage photographs. 
This pack contains 1 roll of Scotch GiftWrap Tape. The roll measures 19mm wide by 16.5m long and is supplied on a handy, refillable dispenser. The easy-to-use dispenser unwinds the tape smoothly and cuts cleanly and evenly, resisting splits and tears. The dispenser can take any roll up to 33m long on a 1 inch core. Larger, weighted dispensers are also available to enable one-handed tape dispensing and make wrapping easier! There is a wide range of colours, shapes and formats to choose from to fit with your workspace or lifestyle.

    <title>Scotch Magic Tape 900 Natural Fibre Film 19mm x 33m (Pack of 3)</title>
    <product_body>Scotch Magic Tape is the essential tape for home, school and office. This strong, general purpose tape looks opaque on the roll, but is virtually invisible when applied. It has a smooth, matte surface which doesn&#8217;t reflect light and therefore won&#8217;t draw attention to itself, giving you a neat and seamless look. It can be written on with pen, pencil or marker, so is great for annotating documents or making labels. It won&#8217;t dry out or &#8216;yellow&#8217; with age, and its low reflectivity means that it won&#8217;t ghost on photocopies &#8211; perfect when you need to attach photos, graphics, or other small items to backing pages in order to photocopy them. 
It is photo-safe and ideal for all general purpose home, office and school tasks such as document mending, sealing envelopes, school projects, scrapbooks and crafts. Thanks to its gentle adhesive, you can stick then re-stick each piece as your project demands, then jot a helpful note with a pen or pencil on top when you're done. 
Scotch Magic Tape &#8211; A Greener Choice is a more eco-friendly tape than traditional alternatives, but offers the same great performance. It is made from more than 53% plant-based materials, including a plant-based, solvent-free adhesive. The core is made from 100% recycled cardboard, and rolls are packaged in boxes made from more than 83% recycled cardboard. This pack consists of 1 box, containing 3 rolls of tape. Each roll measures 19mm wide by 33m long. Scotch Magic Tape can easily be torn by hand, but a wide range of dispensers are available in a variety of colours, shapes and formats to fit with your workspace or lifestyle.

    <title>Scotch Pop-up Tape Dispenser For Gift Wrap</title>
    <product_body>We've all been there when we're gift wrapping - lots of bits of tape across the edge of the table... or getting bits stuck in our teeth as we use them as scissors! There's also the hassle of long strips sticking to themselves or worse - to the wrong place on the paper! Scotch&#174; Tape Strips can change all that. Pre-cut Scotch&#174; Tape Strips pop up one by one from a handy wrist dispenser - leaving both hands free to wrap. And our SatinTM tape is designed to disappear on most gift wraps. Make Christmas easy this year with Scotch&#174; Tape Strips.</product_body>

When your tape runs out, it&#8217;s quick and easy to refill the dispenser with Scotch Magic Tape up to 33 metres long. 
This dispenser is supplied with one roll of Scotch Magic Tape included in the pack. The essential tape for home and office, Scotch Magic Tape is virtually invisible when applied. It has a smooth, matt surface which can be written on; it won&#8217;t yellow with age and it won&#8217;t ghost on photocopies.  Value packs containing multiple rolls are also available, so you&#8217;ll always have a supply for your Scotch Tape Dispenser!

    <title>Scotch Satin Tape Strip Refills Ref 90-ST</title>
    <product_body>Make wrapping at Christmas and birthdays easy with Scotch Pop Up Tape! 
 Wrapping can be stressful time with bits of tape everywhere, and never having enough hands.  Scotch Pop Up Tape Strips can change all that. These clever little pre-cut strips of tape pop up one by one from the Scotch Pop Up Tape Dispenser - leaving both hands free to wrap. 
The tape features a unique satin finish that has low reflectivity and almost disappears on most gift wrap papers for a seamless join. It makes special gifts and parcels look fantastic, and sticks securely to ensure your presents remain under wraps! 
Scotch Pop Up Tape Refill Packs are designed for use with Scotch Pop Up Tape Dispensers. This pack of refills contains 3 pads and each pad contains 75 pre-cut strips of tape, measuring 19mm x 50mm (225 strips in total.)  Scotch Pop Up Tape Dispensers are available in two formats: the Handband Dispenser is mounted on an elasticated strap to wear around the wrist or hand; the DeskGrip Dispenser has a unique gripper base that sticks to smooth horizontal surfaces without adhesive &#8211; great for use on a desk or table.

    <title>Scotch Stiletto Shoe Tape Dispenser - Black</title>
    <product_body>You've got the little black dress, now you can accessorise with a little black shoe. Scotch Magic Tape dispensers keep your tape within easy reach &#8211; great when you&#8217;re wrapping presents, sealing envelopes or mending documents and books. To ensure it stays upright, a clear plastic disc balances the shoe at the heel. 
This dispenser is supplied with one roll of Scotch Magic Tape measuring 19mm wide by 8.9m long - when it runs out, it&#8217;s quick and easy to refill with a roll of Scotch Magic Tape up to 33 metres long. The essential tape for home and office, Scotch Magic Tape is virtually invisible when applied. It has a smooth, matt surface which can be written on; it won&#8217;t yellow with age and it won&#8217;t ghost on photocopies.  Value packs containing multiple rolls are also available, so you&#8217;ll always have a supply for your Scotch Tape Dispenser.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-Brite Non Scratch Design Sponge Scourer Twin Pack (Pack of 5)</title>
    <product_body>Take the hard graft out of housework with the range of high performance cleaning products from Scotch-Brite. For years, 3M have listened to customers and taken on their cleaning challenges in an effort to make life easier. All Scotch-Brite household products have been developed with those pain points in mind, giving you the right tools to speed through your chores with gleaming results all over the house.
A Scotch-Brite Non-Scratch Sponge Scourer adds a pop of cheerful colour to your sink area. Despite their light-hearted appearance, these sponge scourers are made from super-absorbent cellulose that makes quick work of wiping surfaces and mopping up spills. Shaped to provide a comfortable grip, they can reach into tight corners for a really thorough clean and have a light duty scouring surface that is safe to use on non-stick cookware, glass, plastic and delicate surfaces.
 This item includes 5 packs, each containing 2 Scotch-Brite Non-Scratch Design Sponge Scourers (10 in total). Each pack includes 1 x blue sponge and 1 x purple sponge, with a different design on the scouring surface of each. Keep a stock under the sink, share others with friends or family and enjoy the Scotch-Brite feeling of clean for less.
When they need a wash, pop your Scotch-Brite Non-Scratch Sponge Scourers in the dishwasher or sanitise them in boiling water. It is recommended that before using them on a new surface you test first on an inconspicuous area and allow to dry to verify no surface damage. Not for aquarium use.
Scotch-Brite is a trademark of 3M Company.</product_body>

    <title>Monitor Stand, 350mm wide, 250mm deep, 250mm tall, Various Colours Available (Red)</title>
    <product_body>A bespoke item designed and manufactured by SignLine as we couldn't find a suitable monitor stand available anywhere else. The cast acrylics used give a nice gloss finish, the monitor is at eye level and the compartments give plenty of storage space to help keep your desk tidy. The stand is supplied in flat pack form, I have glued one together and another 3 have been slotted together, a tube of super glue is included which you can use to adhere the stand together if you prefer but it is best to assemble a few times to be sure you are happy doing that before adhering. A small amount of super glue can be placed into a channel at a time before placing the sections in. Assemble as shown in the photo's, the top is last to go on and locks all the sections together.</product_body>

    <title>SOFTCUT PRINTING BLOCKS - 75x75x3mm (pack 10)</title>
    <product_body>SoftCutTM is manufactured by us to be the best alternative to Lino - designed to extend the block printing experience to a greater range of people. SoftCutTM is formulated for very easy cutting. It holds fine detail without crumbling and yet stands hard against the pressures of printing presses, this new material can be drawn on in pencil, due to its near white surface. Finely smooth on one side, textured on the other, SoftCutTM is both double sided and flexible. Also available in 45mm diameter discs, which when combined with our specially developed Baren, can be used to create your own stamps. Moulded in a clean environment, fully compliant with both EN 71 and the European Directive for Phthalates.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Scourers With Nailsaver Design 2 Packs of 2 Pads</title>
    <product_body>From quick, light tasks to a deep clean, Scotch-Brite has developed the perfect tools for you to clean, scrub or shine your household surfaces until they sparkle! We have spent years listening to our customers and learning about their cleaning challenges, enabling us to develop our high performance range of cleaning products for each surface, nook or cranny of your house. When you need to shift stubborn grease or burnt-on food, Scotch-BriteTM Heavy Duty Scourers With Nailsaver Design will quickly scour and clean, working up to 50% faster than similar sponge scourers and with twice the efficiency. Their easy-grip design makes them comfortable to hold, whilst their coarse scouring surface makes cleaning a breeze. For worry-free washing up, these pads have a unique design which protects your nails, reducing the need for gloves and the likelihood of broken nails. Once you've powered through the pots, use the super absorbent sponge to wipe down surfaces and the sink. Thanks to their heavy duty cleaning power, these scourers are not suitable for non-stick, delicate or highly polished surfaces. This pack contains 2 Scotch-Brite Heavy Duty Scourers with Nailsaver Design, which can be re-used by washing in either the dishwasher or in boiling water. We recommend that before using them on a new surface you test first on an inconspicuous area and allow to dry to verify no surface damage.</product_body>

    <title>Scotch-BriteTM Mini Lint Roller Coloured Handles</title>
    <product_body>Scotch-BriteTM Mini Lint Roller Coloured Handles. Fluff, pet-hair and dust are part of everyday life, but they can make your clothes, furniture or car look dirty or unkempt. Scotch-BriteTM Lint Rollers have been developed with "sticky" technology to quickly lift lint, fluff, pet-hair, dust and other dry residue from car seats, upholstery and even your clothes without damaging fabric. Hold the lint roller by the ergonomically-designed handle and pass the roll across the fabric you wish to clean. When the top-sheet is covered with fluff and appears to have reduced stickiness, tear it off at the perforation to reveal a new sticky sheet beneath. Save the label to wrap around the outside of your lint roller and you'll stop it from sticking to everything else in your drawer or picking up dirt when you're not using it. A must-have for pet owners, they are also great to keep handy in the car, in your desk or by the front door for a quick spruce up of your clothing before you leave. This mini size is perfectly proportioned for keeping in your briefcase, glove box or handbag - for a neat neckline or a spotless suit on-the-go. This item is a mini lint roller with a comfortably-designed handle and perforated "sticky" sheets. It offers superior adhesion and is quick and easy to use - this is how we roll!</product_body>

Developed by trusted healthcare brand 3M in conjunction with a panel of medical experts, the range offers superb comfort, support and fit for a variety of joint problems and conditions.
The knee is one of the largest joints in the human body, and one of the most complex. With its incredible three-dimensional range of motion, it can often be a source of pain due to injury, aging, surgery or physical inactivity. The Futuro Comfort Lift Knee Support provides relief and compression to knees that need it, helping to ease the discomfort of sprains, strains, arthritis and swelling without restricting normal movement. Made from breathable, dual-stretch knitted material, it incorporates a comfort panel to reduce &#8216;bunching&#8217; behind the knee and is sleek enough to fit discreetly under clothing &#8211; enabling you to keep up with your busy schedule and walk through your day with confidence.
This pack contains one Futuro Comfort Lift Knee Support in beige, size Medium. It is reversible and can be worn on either the left or the right knee, providing a mild level of support. The Medium size will fit knees with a diameter of 36.8-43.2cm (measure around the kneecap whilst in a standing position). Caution: This product contains natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions.

    <title>Nexcare Coldhot Maternity Compress</title>
    <product_body>Nexcare ColdHot Therapy products are gel-filled compresses with dual purpose: they can provide either flexible ice or soothing heat as a drug-free way to treat pain and inflammation locally. The non-toxic gel is encased in a strong, reliable plastic envelope, which is shaped like a horseshoe to leave the nipple area free and flexible enough to mould to your breast and sit comfortably inside your nursing bra.
The compresses are hand washable and reusable, and are supplied with soft fabric protective covers. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or warmed up by placing in hot water. Cold therapy can be an effective way to relieve breast congestion and alleviate pain in the case of mastitis or inflammation; when used warm, the compresses can help to stimulate milk flow, unblock ducts and soothe the discomfort of engorgement. They may also be used as an aid to reduce post-operative swelling and discomfort following breast surgery: Please consult your doctor before purchasing for this purpose.

    <title>Nexcare Neckwarmer Refill</title>
    <product_body>The neck can be a focal point of tension and stress, often causing pain to spread to the head and the rest of the body. Applying soothing heat is one of the oldest known, natural ways to treat muscular tension, relieving pain and promoting relaxation in the affected area.
This pack contains 6 heat pads for use with the Nexcare Neck Warmer (not supplied) - a comfortable, easy-to-use collar that provides medication-free relief from aches and pains in the neck and shoulders. Simply remove one of the heat pads from its packet and shake it for a few seconds &#8211; no microwave or hot water required! Contact with the air will activate the heat pad, which will then continue to give off warmth for up to 7 hours. Slip the pad into the pocket of your neck warmer and position it directly over the back of the neck. Should you only need to use the neck warmer for a short period of time, the heat pad can be removed and stored in an airtight plastic bag, ready to use at a later date.
Nexcare Neck Warmers are available from Amazon and larger pharmacies. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product for the first time.

    <title>Nexcare ColdHot Back and Abdomen Belt S/M</title>
    <product_body>Nexcare Cold Hot Therapy products are gel-filled compresses with dual purpose: they can provide either flexible ice or comforting heat as a drug-free way to treat pain locally. A great alternative to dripping ice packs or leaky hot water bottles, they can be cooled in the fridge or freezer, or warmed up in the microwave or by placing in hot water. Choose cold therapy to treat acute injuries and relieve the pain of musculoskeletal injury (the cold will help to reduce the swelling, inflammation and pain); or heat to ease pain and reduce muscle spasm associated with chronic back pain, period pain and rheumatoid arthritis.
Nexcare Cold Hot Gel Compresses are hand washable and reusable. This pack includes a simple-to-use, adjustable belt that holds the compress in place against the back or abdomen and gives light support. Simply cool or warm up your compress as per the instructions in the box, slip it into the pocket of the belt and secure the belt firmly in place. The belt is composed of several layers of fabric, including 3M&#8217;s patented Thinsulate insulation material. This helps keep the compress at a constant temperature for longer, giving you prolonged periods of pain relief before you need to re-cool or reheat it. Please note that cold therapy should be applied for a maximum of 20 minutes, before removing the compress for another 20 minutes and then reapplying. Customers are advised to read the enclosed instructions carefully before using this product.

    <title>Post-it&#174; Super Sticky Die Cut Star 150 Sheets</title>
    <product_body>Post-it Super Sticky Notes stick around as long as you need them to. Perfect for vertical and hard-to-stick-to surfaces, they are super-strong, super-adhesive, super-versatile - and super-stand-out. With a range of sizes and bright colours they really get your messages noticed.
These notes feature a strong but repositionable adhesive - they can cling to both smooth and rough surfaces and stick for longer on walls, doors, mirrors and fridges. The adhesive won't leave marks on your walls or pages, so you can stick them wherever they&#8217;ll be noticed to keep your family, colleagues &#8230; and yourself organised!
This pack contains 2 pads of star-shaped Post-it Super Sticky Notes &#8211; 1 x yellow pad and 1 x orange pad. Each pad contains 75 sheets measuring 73mm x 71mm - the perfect size for a quick reminder! Do your kids forget their lunchboxes or sports kit every morning? Why not leave them a message on the inside of the front door so they see it before they leave the house? Will your husband remember to pick up his dry cleaning on the way home? Stick a note on his laptop or briefcase so he&#8217;s got no excuse! The star shape adds a bit of fun and will really catch their attention.
For messages that really stick, get organised with Super Sticky Post-it Notes!

Our Lino, made especially soft for block printing, is ideal for the student and master alike. Made using natural materials such as linseed oil and wood flour, our Lino is even biodegradable. Supplied in popular sizes, this is the first choice for education, hobby and professional use, achieving rapid results without specialist material or equipment. Can be used with oil and water based inks and prints on a wide range of paper, board and fabric.</product_body>

    <product_body>The traditional craft of Lino cutting and printing is a popular and creative educational pastime for children and adults in schools and colleges and an enjoyable creative craft at home. Lino prints well onto most papers, card and fabric giving endless creative opportunities, the opportunity to develop new skills and an appreciation of traditional printing techniques. Students can be encouraged to make their own prints, scrapbook artefacts, greeting cards, party invitations, gift labels, posters or even great works of art! Our Lino, made especially soft for block printing, is ideal for the student and master alike. Made using natural materials such as linseed oil and wood flour, our Lino is even biodegradable. Supplied in popular sizes, this is the first choice for education, hobby and professional use, achieving rapid results without specialist material or equipment. Can be used with oil and water based inks and prints on a wide range of paper, board and fabric.</product_body>

    <title>Standard Lino Roller 300mm</title>
    <product_body>Our sturdy hard rubber roller is perfect for printmaking and a default choice for education
and purchasing authorities worldwide. The rigid body and steel brackets give strength
to the durable 70 shore EPDM rubber roller enabling heavy use, out-performing natural rubber. Suitable for use with both water
based and oil based ink, and also resistant to solvents. The handle is manufactured from
durable polypropylene with a hanging slot. The roller has self lubricating nylon bearings, EPDM
rubber surface, aluminium core and a continuous steel shaft. It is designed so that wet rollers
can be turned over with the handle doubling as a stand for cleaner working. These versatile
rollers can be used for a variety of purposes other than block printing, including scrapbooking,
laminating and even industrial processes like the application of window films and vehicle
graphics.</product_body>

    <title>Standard Lino Roller 200mm</title>
    <product_body>Our sturdy hard rubber roller is perfect for printmaking and a default choice for education
and purchasing authorities worldwide. The rigid body and steel brackets give strength
to the durable 70 shore EPDM rubber roller enabling heavy use, out-performing natural rubber. Suitable for use with both water
based and oil based ink, and also resistant to solvents. The handle is manufactured from
durable polypropylene with a hanging slot. The roller has self lubricating nylon bearings, EPDM
rubber surface, aluminium core and a continuous steel shaft. It is designed so that wet rollers
can be turned over with the handle doubling as a stand for cleaner working. These versatile
rollers can be used for a variety of purposes other than block printing, including scrapbooking,
laminating and even industrial processes like the application of window films and vehicle
graphics.</product_body>

    <title>Nexcare Aqua 360 Strips</title>
    <product_body>Uniquely shaped Nexcare Aqua waterproof plasters are designed for a better seal around the wound, providing 360 degree protection. Based on a unique technology from 3M's healthcare division, the plasters are made from a very light, film-like material that provides tremendous waterproof properties and is less likely to be caught on objects due to its low profile.
 Nexcare Products from 3M--the makers of 3M Steri-Strip First Aid Skin Closures, Micropore First Aid Tape, Littmann Stethescopes and many other leading healthcare brands.

    <product_body>When you have a deeper wound or cut to the skin, you need something more than a plaster to promote healing and protect against infection. NexcareTM Steri-Strip First Aid Skin Closures are highly effective for closing deeper wounds, such as cuts or surgery scars. These advanced Skin Closures will reduce bleeding and prevent cuts from re-opening, allowing the skin's natural healing process to take place more efficiently. Nexcare Steri-Strip Skin Closures are easy to apply and remove, and will provide immediate closure and protection for deeper wounds. They are low-allergy, meaning that they are highly tolerated by most people and have long-lasting staying power. The pack contains 5 strips of 3mm x 75 mm and 3 strips of 6 mm x 75 mm. Important: Steri-Strip First Aid Skin Closures are not an alternative to stitches. If the wound is deep and bleeding continuously, seek medical assistance immediately.</product_body>

    <title>Command Medium Antique Bronze Hooks with Strips (FC12-AB)</title>
    <product_body>Give your bits and pieces a place to live with Command Antique Bronze Hooks. These decorative metal hooks can each hold up to 1kg in weight, making them the ideal organisational solution for your home or office. They can be applied to almost any flat, clean surface. When you want to rearrange, the hooks are easily and cleanly removed without damaging the surface underneath &#8211; no cracks, holes, damaged plaster, sticky residue or stains. Want to use a hook again? Just reattach it using a new Command Adhesive Strip &#8211; each pack includes a spare, and refill packs are available. 
These antique-effect hooks will complement classic home d&#233;cor perfectly. The medium-sized version is ideal for hanging coats, towels and bathrobes. Many Command fans tell us that they use this type of hook to display their Christmas wreath on the front door, as the antique finish matches the rest of their door furniture. Once January rolls around, it&#8217;s easy to take down the hook without damaging the paintwork underneath, and the hook can be used year after year with replacement adhesive strips. 
Command products are perfect in rented accommodation where you can&#8217;t put screws in the walls or are worried about marks and stains. They hold strongly on a whole range of surfaces including paint, wood, metal and tiles, but aren&#8217;t suitable for use on wallpapered surfaces or for hanging antiques or other valuable or irreplaceable items. When you want to take one down, grasp the hook and slide it upwards to remove it from the mounting base. The hook and mounting base can be re-used with a new adhesive strip. To remove the Command Adhesive Strip from the wall, hold the plastic base gently and pull the tab straight down, slowly stretching it until the strip releases from the wall. All of these instructions are detailed on the back of the pack. 
Command is a trademark of 3M Company.</product_body>

    <title>3M 1410r Vetrap Bandaging Tape, 10 cm x 4.5 m, Box of 18 Rolls, Red</title>
    <product_body>3M Vetrap bandaging tape is the original cohesive wrap for equine and small animals, providing a great combination of softness, strength and conformability.
Vetrap tape adheres to itself without adhesive so no additional fasteners are necessary. It conforms snugly around contours that are most difficult to bandage and accommodates movement without loosening.
Preferred by veterinary professionals; it allows skin to breathe through its cool, lightweight, porous material and absorbs virtually no moisture.
Use it as a hoof wrap, for rundown protection or dressing secural, to support sprains and fractures and as a tail wrap.
Available in a wide choice of colours Vetrap is a must for the first aid kit.
For support and protection, stick with Vetrap tape.

    <title>Scotch-Brite Surface Preparation Pad 15" (10 x Pads)</title>
    <product_body>Scotch-Brite Surface Preperation Pads require only neutral cleaner or water to effectively remove floor finish, preparing the floor for finish application.
This premium quality Scotch-BriteTM floor pad effectively removes floor finish, leaving a surface ready for recoating. Unlike most floor stripping pads, the Surface Preparation Pad works efficiently with just neutral cleaner or water, reducing the need for chemical strippers, and reducing labour and material costs normally associated with the process. 
Application: Stripping</product_body>

    <title>Lino Cutter No 3 (Box of 5)</title>
    <product_body>No. 3 Cutter. A tight, round cutter able to cut a 2mm deep sided line where needed. Great in straight lines, but more difficult to turn. Great in SoftCutTM but cut too deep in lino and the upright walls of the cut can leave little support and weaken the top surface. With practice, it's useful for cutting small circles by using a swivel motion.</product_body>

    <title>Lino Cutter No 1 (Box of 5)</title>
    <product_body>No. 1 Cutter For fine lines and cross hatching. Use at a steep angle and push forward with light pressure being sure not to go deep. Never try to plunge any cutter deeper than the ground sides of the point. With practice, a line of 0.5mm (0.020") or less is possible in SoftCutTM material and a little wider in Lino. Care is needed when inking up over lines this fine as it is easy to push the ink into shallow lines with a soft brayer (lino roller).</product_body>

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Tab3 Kids 7-inch Tablet</title>
    <product_body>With a bright, easy-to-use interface and kid-friendly app store, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids is the ideal tablet for your kids' digital playing and learning time. Preloaded with top-ranked apps for kids, the lightweight Galaxy Tab 3 Kids also features a built-in camera and parental controls for access and time limits. It transforms from kid to standard mode so you can enjoy the same familiar features as a regular Galaxy Tab 3.
The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids features a kid-centric interface with bright colours and animated characters to make playing and learning more fun for your little one. Each app appears as a card that your child can select by simply tapping. Kids can personalise their play by adding their name, choosing a character to guide them, and changing the background.
The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids has a brilliant 7-inch display, with HD 1024x600 resolution, so text is clearer and colours are brighter. The powerful 1.2 GHz dual-core processor makes it ideal for downloading apps and games, and watching your favorite movies.
Samsung's Kids' Store is filled with top apps for learning and playing. The kid-friendly apps are organised by category, so your kids can browse apps based on their preferences. Instead of buying, kids add each app to a wish list that can be accessed through parental controls, letting you choose which ones to purchase.
Not only will you have full control over what apps your kids buy and explore, you can also choose your own Google Play apps to add to the Kids Mode by simply checking off those apps in Application Manager. Add Skype if you want to let them video chat with Grandma, or add video apps like Netflix.
The built-in camera is specially designed for kids to take pictures and shoot videos. They can use the 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for silly faces, or flip it around to capture their surroundings with the 3-megapixel rear camera. Virtual stickers let them play pretend and dress up their pictures with different features and accessories. 
Kids Gallery and Kids Video store all their photos and videos so they can revisit their favorite shots. Parental control mode lets you access their work in your gallery and share with other relatives.
The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids includes features just for parents, so you can hand over the tablet with peace of mind. A secure password entry gives you access to parental controls that let you set time restrictions on their usage, control what they view, and choose which apps you want to purchase.
The lightweight, 7-inch design makes the Galaxy Tab 3 Kids ideal for little hands. It weighs less than 1lb, so it's easy for little ones to hold in their car seat or for you to carry in your purse or nappy bag.
The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids allows you to easily switch from Kids Mode to standard mode, giving you access to the same interface and features of the regular Galaxy Tab 3. Both modes can coexist, so you can switch back and forth without losing content. This makes it easy for parents to stream videos and music, read e-books, or browse up to 750,000 apps from Google Play before switching back to Kids Mode.
This tablet comes installed with Android 4.1.2, Jelly Bean, contains a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, and has a 7-inch display with 1024x600 resolution, a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It also comes with 8GB of internal memory and features a microSD card slot (microSD card sold separately) that allows you to add up to 32GB of additional memory. 
The tablet measures 7.4 by 4.37 by 0.39 inches (H x W x D) and weighs 0.67lbs including the battery.

    <title>Safety Hand Guard</title>
    <product_body>This device is an essential safety measure in multi student environments. The natural instinct is to drive a cutting gouge towards the restraining hand holding the work piece, so we have created a guard that covers the smallest to the more dexterous larger hand, in one item. The guard is held either at the corner of the relief block or on top of the carving material close to the area to be cut. Any slippage is caught in the upright walls of the guard protecting the user from harm. An ergonomic, left or right handed, one piece moulding at a price that makes its inclusion in your tool box and school room a must.</product_body>

    <title>3M SandBlaster Sandpaper Abrasive Sheets Assorted P60, P100 &amp;P180 Pk 3</title>
    <product_body>When you have sanding and prep work to do, 3M offers a wide range of high performance sandpapers, flexible abrasives, sanding sponges and tools. Select the best sanding tool for the task and you will have less work on your hands, with supreme results. SandBlasterTM Sandpaper is coated with mineral and features an advanced, durable backing material that resists tearing, for a satisfying day's work.

3M SandBlasterTM Sandpaper can be used on a wide range of surfaces including paint, wood, metal, plastic, filler and fibreglass. This evenly coated sandpaper resists clogging and tearing - when dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! These sheets of sandpaper can be used by hand, or with sanding blocks or machine sanders. When compared to conventional alternatives of comparable grits, SandBlaster Sandpaper cuts up to three times faster, stays sharp and delivers a smoother, long-lasting finish.

This pack contains 3 different grades of SandBlaster Sandpaper, each cut into a long-lasting sheet which measures 230 mm x 280 mm. The coarse grit P60 sheet is perfect for paint-stripping; the medium grit P100 sheet is your go-to for levelling bare surfaces; and the fine grit P180 sheet is ideal for a smooth finish or between coats of paint or varnish. To make hand sanding easier, why not try the 3M Rubber Sanding Block? Simply attach a piece of SandBlaster Sandpaper to the heavyweight block for an improved grip, extra power and better sanding control.

Material: Aluminium Oxide. It is recommended that a suitable respirator and safety goggles/glasses are worn during sanding. Sanding lead based paints can be hazardous.

SandBlaster Sandpaper: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.</product_body>

    <title>3M Sandblaster 60-080 High-Performance Sandpaper P80/Coarse for Paint Removal 230 x 280 mm Pack of 3</title>
    <product_body>When you have sanding and prep work to do, 3M offers a wide range of high performance sandpapers, flexible abrasives, sanding sponges and tools. Select the best sanding tool for the task and you will have less work on your hands, with supreme results. SandBlasterTM Sandpaper is coated with mineral and features an advanced, durable backing material that resists tearing, for a satisfying day's work.

SandBlasterTM Sandpaper Coarse Grit is a heavy duty sandpaper for stripping surfaces including paint, wood, metal, plastic and fibreglass. It can also be used for removing ingrained marks and blemishes from wood and metal. This evenly coated sandpaper resists clogging and tearing - when dust builds up, simply knock it off the abrasive surface and carry on! These sheets of sandpaper can be used by hand, or with sanding blocks or orbital sanders. When compared to conventional alternatives of comparable grits, SandBlaster Sandpaper cuts up to three times faster, stays sharp and delivers a smoother, long-lasting finish.

This pack contains 3 sheets of SandBlaster Sandpaper P80 Coarse Grit, each of which measures 230 mm x 280 mm. Designed for sanding flat areas such as table tops or walls, the sheets are ideal for hand sanding or can be easily cut into smaller pieces for use with an electrical sander. To make hand sanding easier, why not try the 3M Rubber Sanding Block? Simply attach a piece of SandBlaster Sandpaper to the heavyweight block for an improved grip, extra power and better sanding control.

Material: Aluminium Oxide. It is recommended that a suitable respirator and safety goggles/glasses are worn during sanding. Sanding lead based paints can be hazardous.

SandBlaster Sandpaper: Less work. Cuts fast. Lasts long.</product_body>

    <product_body>If you're keen on craft and card-making and like to work mess-free, you'll love our range of adhesive tapes. For use with the Scotch&#174; ATG Adhesive Transfer Tape Applicator Gun, they make for cleaner, more accurate crafting. Simply insert your chosen tape into the ATG Gun, press the trigger and away you go. Our general purpose Adhesive Transfer Tape is perfect for bonding to paper and card. It creates thinner bond lines with a uniform thickness, giving you a more professional finish. Whether you're sticking paper, card, tissue, cloth, glitter or sequins, this tape works for so many hobby and craft needs! Ideal for detailed embellishments on cards, invitations and other stationery, it also makes adding inserts quicker and more efficient, without the seeping or wrinkling you can get with traditional glue. Strong and durable, it holds even heavy card and lasts well - great when you're making keepsakes and gifts that people want to treasure or frame. Say goodbye to fiddly double-sided tape - when used with the Scotch ATG Adhesive Tape Applicator Gun, the liner is removed as you stick, saving your time and patience!</product_body>

    <title>Scotch Tape Glider Refill Rolls box of 2 acid-free adhesive transfer tape 1/4 in. [PACK OF 3 ]</title>
    <product_body>ATG Tape Refills - Home Crafts Made Easy Make all your arts and crafts projects easier with the Scotch&#174; Advanced Tape Glider and Refill Rolls. These rolls fit easily into the glider to allow for a quick, controlled application of adhesive in neat, thin lines, giving you a mess-free, professional finish. Whether you're card-making, scrapbooking, mounting photographs or making stationery, our General Purpose Tape covers all your crafting needs. Using the Advanced Tape Glider makes your projects quicker, cleaner and more satisfying. Rather than traditional glue, which can seep and wrinkle, the tape leaves flat, neat lines. The adhesive liner is removed as you stick, too, saving your time and patience! Strong and durable, our General Purpose Tape is great when you're making keepsakes that people will want to treasure or frame. The adhesive won't dry out, yellow or peel and can be used on all sorts of textiles - an excellent addition to your crafting toolbox. For use with the Scotch&#174; Advanced Tape Glider, sold separately.</product_body>

    <title>SOFT RUBBER LINO INK ROLLER (50mm)</title>
    <product_body>A soft compound EPDM at 40 shore. Resistant to printers chemicals and not ffected by exposure to daylight, this is a long life product.

They are made to the same exacting standards as our standard rollers, but have a soft, 40 shore rubber surface for the easy, smooth and fine application of ink. Manufactured from durable polypropylene with self lubricating nylon bearings, robust constuction, EPDM rubber, hanging slot, aluminium core and a continuous steel shaft. These versatile rollers can be used for a variety of purposes other than lino-printing.</product_body>

    <title>DELUXE INK ROLLER/BRAYER 300mm</title>
    <product_body>These high quality deluxe rollers, with their distinctive black handles, have a higher ink capacity. They are made to the same exacting standards as our standard rollers, but have a full-ground, concentric rolling surface for the smooth and fine application of ink. Manufactured from durable polypropylene with self lubricating nylon bearings, robust constuction, EPDM rubber, hanging slot, aluminium core and a continuous steel shaft. These versatile rollers can be used for a variety of purposes other than lino-printing. With a hand-ground surface of over 122mm (4.5"), this perfectly smooth heavy-weight roller holds a greater quantity of ink than our standard range allowing greater coverage and perfect results every time. A hand-ground concentric EPDM rubber surface is a medium hard 60 shore and gives excellent pickup and deposit of all types of ink. This tool is the choice for the artisan printmaker with good recovery to indentation, and resistance to common printing chemicals. Perfect for printmaking, applying self adhesive film/vinyl, wood engraving and woodcut.</product_body>

    <title>DELUXE INK ROLLER/BRAYER 200mm</title>
    <product_body>These high quality deluxe rollers, with their distinctive black handles, have a higher ink capacity. They are made to the same exacting standards as our standard rollers, but have a full-ground, concentric rolling surface for the smooth and fine application of ink. Manufactured from durable polypropylene with self lubricating nylon bearings, robust constuction, EPDM rubber, hanging slot, aluminium core and a continuous steel shaft. These versatile rollers can be used for a variety of purposes other than lino-printing. With a hand-ground surface of over 122mm (4.5"), this perfectly smooth heavy-weight roller holds a greater quantity of ink than our standard range allowing greater coverage and perfect results every time. A hand-ground concentric EPDM rubber surface is a medium hard 60 shore and gives excellent pickup and deposit of all types of ink. This tool is the choice for the artisan printmaker with good recovery to indentation, and resistance to common printing chemicals. Perfect for printmaking, applying self adhesive film/vinyl, wood engraving and woodcut.</product_body>

    <title>Bellelli B-Travel Bike Trailer With Urban Stroller Kit, Current Version</title>
    <product_body>IMPROVEMENTS IN THE NEW B-TAXI VERSION

Wheels have been moved back.
The wheels are now better vertically lined up with the children's baricenter, thus improving the weights
distribution and reducing the weight burdening on the bike. This change brings many positive effects, such
as a better handiness and a higher stability during the braking and the movement in curve.

The safety belts have been attached to the frame- before they were sewn on the sitting/back textile .
This evolution considerably increases the safety of the system which is directly attached to the plastic base
and to the steel arch holding the cover.

Parking brake
We have introduced a brake that can easily be operated on by foot. The baby trailer is much more stable and
safe both when parked and when babies accede and get off.

Closing system modified.
We have introduced a second safety mechanism on both sides of the baby trailer, reducing the risk of
possible wrong operations of parents.

Homologation
The baby trailer will soon get the certification according the most recent European norm EN15918. It will be
one of the first baby trailers on the market being certified according to this norm.

Cover
The accessibility has been improved thanks to the new textile, more airy and bright.
Back case
We have added a piece of textile to better cover the case and protect it from bad weather.

Stroller function
The baby trailer can be also used as stroller: we have developed a kit (included) composed by a front wheel (with
locking and unlocking system very easy, simple and fast) and a handle, to allow the easily shift to this other
function.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature>Exclusive, patented plastic base, protects against rocks and mud, exclusively patented by bellelli.</feature>
      <feature>5 point harness, for 1 or 2 children. Wide openings on front and roof</feature>
      <feature>Mult-layer canopy: retractable sunshade, protective mesh and transparent weather cover</feature>
      <feature>20'' wheels with quick release system. Easy to use parking brake Large rear pocket.</feature>
      <feature>Quickly and easily foldable Urban Stroller conversion kit, with 12'' swivelling wheel and handle.</feature>

</url>
    <title>3M MP160 Pocket Projector</title>
    <product_body>Share your favourite movies, make business presentations, or project photo slideshows virtually anywhere with the 3M PocketProjector MP160. Ideal for mobile professionals and proud parents alike, this palm-sized, versatile projector lets you display crisp images of up to 80 inches from the digital content on your laptop, digital camera, DVD player, smartphone, gaming console, and more. Two hours of battery life and a consistent light output ensure dependable, professional projections and presentations every time.
With the PocketProjector MP160, you won't have to gather around a small phone screen or a difficult-to-read laptop in order to share your digital content. And you can keep your cumbersome office projector back at the office where it belongs.
Weighing a mere 300 grams and measuring a compact 150x65x30.5 mm (L x W x H), this versatile projector can be carried comfortably in a bag or pocket and fits in the palm of your hand. It connects to a wide range of devices via the included VGA and composite video cables for native high-resolution projections of up to 800 by 600 pixels. The MP160 can also support SVGA, XGA and WXGA resolution in a 4:3 aspect ratio. The MP160 allows you to instantly project your media content with plug and play simplicity.
The MP160 is not only ideal for business presentations, but it is also handy for family gatherings or movies with friends. All you need is a flat surface to project videos, photo slideshows, web sites, and more from your smartphone, laptop, digital camera, DVD player, or other digital device. The MP160 arrives with VGA and composite video cables to ensure you can quickly begin sharing your media. The MP160 can also be connected to Apple products via an adapter cable (sold separately). 
Boasting twice the lumens of its predecessor, the MP160's display remains consistently bright--even when you're running the device on its lithium-ion polymer battery. A full two hours of battery life increases the projector's versatility, and even when those batteries are getting low you can always rely on the MP160 to maintain the same level of brightness.
The MP160 comes equipped with two built-in 3/4-watt speakers that produce robust sound for enjoying music, movies, and videos. It also features audio out, so you can take advantage of headphones or additional speakers via a generic 3.5mm audio jack.
The device's intuitive buttons couldn't be easier to operate, a simple on/off function, volume controls with mute option, and a battery life indicator. The MP160 also features a flip stand intuitively built in to the base of the unit, offering a stable height adjustment, while the universal 6.35mm tripod socket allows the user to manipulate height with the 3M tripod supplied, or utilise compatible tripods and security locks.
The MP160 is compatible with DVD players, digital camcorders, digital cameras, gaming consoles, laptops, tablets, PCs, smartphones and portable media players.
Based on smartphone capability, the MP160 can make the small screen of your phone large and easy to show to groups. Be sure to test with your phones, as some manufacturers block content out of phones, while older devices (such as previous generations of BlackBerry) do not have a video- or TV-out and can therefore not be connected to the MP160.
The 3M PocketProjector MP160 is backed by a one-year limited warranty.

For use with the Scotch&#174; ATG Adhesive Transfer Tape Applicator Gun, they make for cleaner, more accurate crafting. Simply insert your chosen tape into the ATG Gun, press the trigger and away you go.

Our Acid-Free Adhesive Transfer Tape is just what you need if you're mounting photographs onto card or updating scrapbooks or albums. This tape has been designed so that you don't have to worry about damaging your precious snapshots, as it leaves no discoloration and won't cause fading. The adhesive tape creates thin bond lines with a uniform thickness, for clean, accurate sticking. This tape size offers a slightly wider adhesive line compared to the 12 mm x 55 mm roll.

Whether you're attaching your photographs to paper, card or albums, using the Scotch ATG Adhesive Transfer Tape Applicator Gun makes things so much quicker and neater, and the tape doesn't create the seeping or wrinkling that you can get with traditional glue.

Strong and durable, it holds well and you can be assured it will last - great when you're making keepsakes that people will want to treasure or frame. The adhesive won't dry out and make your photos slip from the page. Even better, when using the ATG Gun, there's no fiddling around, as the adhesive liner is removed as you stick, saving your time and patience!</product_body>

    <title>3M Tyre Restorer</title>
    <product_body>Tyres are a tell-tale sign of the age and condition of your car. If they look dull and grey, the appearance of your entire vehicle suffers. 3MTM Tyre Restorer will instantly take miles off your tyres by restoring them to their natural, deep black colour.

There's no better way to finish off your car cleaning regime than with 3M Tyre Restorer. Its mess-free formula is quick and easy to use, giving tyres a long-lasting, natural shine without slinging. With touch-ups required less frequently, this is an extremely cost effective solution not only for tyres - but for vinyl mouldings and rubber bumpers too.

Supplied in a spray bottle, 3M Tyre Restorer is simple to use. Any leftover residue can be quickly wiped up with a 3M Microfibre Detailing Cloth without the risk of staining. It's also the perfect partner for 3MTM Wheel and Tyre Cleaner: when combined, these two products can give tyres a completely new look and showroom quality finish.</product_body>

    <title>Boat Wax - 3MTM Marine Ultra Performance Paste Wax</title>
    <product_body>When your boat is on dry land, it's the perfect time to clean and compound the hull to remove oxidisation, polish for a deep gloss and then rub in a protective coating of boat wax. 3M Marine Ultra Performance Paste Wax is a professional product with exceptional coverage that goes on easily and polishes off quickly, saving you time and effort. Its unique polymer technology combines the durability of acrylic with the soil-release and water-beading properties of silicone - so you get a deep shine that protects against UV damage for longer. Less time waxing, more time boating.

This pack contains 1 x 269g can of 3M Marine Ultra Performance Paste Boat Wax.

Whether you are restoring a boat or just trying to maintain its shine, gently navigating canals or sail boat racing, our chandlery supplies can help you achieve a high quality, professional finish quickly - leaving you more time to get out on the water.</product_body>

    <title>Boat cleaner - 3MTM Marine Vinyl Cleaner 250 ml Bottle</title>
    <product_body>Plastics and vinyls are found all over modern and older vessels, and can let down the overall appearance of a boat if they are not maintained. The 3M range of boat cleaning products is designed specifically for the harsh marine environment, helping you to clean and extend the life of these materials inside and out.

3M Marine Vinyl Cleaner is a one-step product that conditions and protects vinyl, plastic and rubber surfaces as it cleans - creating a long-lasting protective barrier that withstands repeated cleaning and prevents damage from sunlight.

This pack contains 1 x 250 ml pump spray bottle of 3M Marine Vinyl Cleaner. Its unique gel formula is easier to control during application, for less wastage.

Whether you are restoring a boat or just trying to maintain its shine, gently navigating canals or sail boat racing, our chandlery supplies can help you achieve a high quality, professional finish quickly - leaving you more time to get out on the water.</product_body>

    <title>ScotchBlue Painter's Tape Advanced Delicate Surface, 25.4mm x 54.8m (2080EL-24E) - 1 roll</title>
    <product_body>ScotchBlue Painter&#8217;s Tape gives you the opportunity to achieve a high quality, decorator&#8217;s finish to your project &#8211; without having to call in the professionals! Traditional masking tape products can leave messy edges and sticky, torn pieces of tape to ruin the effect of your hard work: This ScotchBlue Painter&#8217;s Tape features a flat backing, meaning that it sticks smoothly and securely but can be removed cleanly up to 60 days later with no residue or surface damage.  It is UV/sunlight resistant so ideal for use on window frames. In addition, ScotchBlue Painter's Tape Advanced Delicate Surface features a 3M proprietary technology called Edge-Lock Paint Line Protector, which repels paint away from the edge of the tape to give you super sharp lines with no bleed-through or seepage underneath.
ScotchBlue Painter's Tape Advanced Delicate Surface is perfect for everyone from DIY painters to commercial and residential professionals. Its low- to medium-adhesion means that it can be applied to freshly painted areas (24 hours old) and other delicate substrates; its flat backing allows for a super sharp line on smooth surfaces &#8211; great for design features, accent walls and stripes.  What&#8217;s more, this tape can be removed cleanly, with no surface damage, up to 60 days later: perfect for longer-term projects or those that require work over several weekends. For easy identification, it now has the ScotchBlue logo and product number printed in orange on the tape itself. You&#8217;ll be able to find it easily in a drawer or tool box and know what you're choosing and using. This pack contains 1 roll of ScotchBlue Painter&#8217;s Tape Advanced Delicate Surface. The roll is 25.4mm wide and 54.8m long.
Get the edge you deserve with ScotchBlue Painter's Tape Advanced Delicate Surface with Edge-Lock Paint Line Protector &#8211; for brilliant looks and unlimited ways to transform your space.

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7-inch for Kids -  (includes Bumper Cover and Carry Case )</title>
    <product_body>With a bright, easy-to-use interface, kid-friendly app store, and durable case, the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids is the ideal tablet for your kids' digital playing and learning time. Preloaded with top-ranked apps for kids, the lightweight Galaxy Tab 3 Kids also features a built-in camera and parental controls for access and time limits. It transforms from kid to standard mode so you can enjoy the same familiar features as a regular Galaxy Tab 3.
The Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 Kids features a kid-centric interface with bright colours and animated characters to make playing and learning more fun for your little one. Each app appears as a card that your child can select by simply tapping. Kids can personalise their play by adding their name, choosing a character to guide them, and changing the background.
The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids has a brilliant 7-inch display, with HD 1024x600 resolution, so text is clearer and colours are brighter. The powerful 1.2 GHz dual-core processor makes it ideal for downloading apps and games, and watching your favorite movies.
Samsung's Kids' Store is filled with top apps for learning and playing. The kid-friendly apps are organised by category, so your kids can browse apps based on their preferences. Instead of buying, kids add each app to a wish list that can be accessed through parental controls, letting you choose which ones to purchase.
Not only will you have full control over what apps your kids buy and explore, you can also choose your own Google Play apps to add to the Kids Mode by simply checking off those apps in Application Manager. Add Skype if you want to let them video chat with Grandma, or add video apps like Netflix.
The built-in camera is specially designed for kids to take pictures and shoot videos. They can use the 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera for silly faces, or flip it around to capture their surroundings with the 3-megapixel rear camera. Virtual stickers let them play pretend and dress up their pictures with different features and accessories. 
Kids Gallery and Kids Video store all their photos and videos so they can revisit their favorite shots. Parental control mode lets you access their work in your gallery and share with other relatives.
The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids includes features just for parents, so you can hand over the tablet with peace of mind. A secure password entry gives you access to parental controls that let you set time restrictions on their usage, control what they view, and choose which apps you want to purchase.
The drop-tested bump case is tough enough to withstand daily drops and spills. The soft cover is CPSC certified as a nontoxic material, so it's safe if your teething toddler gets hold of it. 
The lightweight, 7-inch design makes the Galaxy Tab 3 Kids ideal for little hands. It weighs less than 1lb, so it's easy for little ones to hold in their car seat or for you to carry in your purse or nappy bag.
The Galaxy Tab 3 Kids allows you to easily switch from Kids Mode to standard mode, giving you access to the same interface and features of the regular Galaxy Tab 3. Both modes can coexist, so you can switch back and forth without losing content. This makes it easy for parents to stream videos and music, read e-books, or browse up to 750,000 apps from Google Play before switching back to Kids Mode.
This tablet comes installed with Android 4.1.2, Jelly Bean, contains a 1.2 GHz dual-core processor, and has a 7-inch display with 1024x600 resolution, a 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera, and a 3-megapixel rear-facing camera. It also comes with 8GB of internal memory and features a microSD card slot (microSD card sold separately) that allows you to add up to 32GB of additional memory. 
The tablet measures 7.4 by 4.37 by 0.39 inches (H x W x D) and weighs 0.67lbs including the battery. Up to 7 hours battery life.

    <title>Avery Dennison Prismatic High Reflective Conspicuity Tape, For Rigid Surfaces, V-6701B Euro CT Yellow, 3 metres by 50mm</title>
    <product_body>Many accidents are avoidable if the driver of the other vehicle had only been able to detect the truck. Reflective contour markings on trucks make detection easy, giving drivers time to see a vehicle, react and avoid a collision. In fact, NHTSA studies demonstrate 41 percent reduction in side and rear trailer impact when using conspicuity tape. Avery Dennison V-6700B Series Conspicuity Tape provides superior reflectivity and may help reduce accidents, prevent injuries and can decrease related costs such as repairs, insurance expenses and fees.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature>Avery Dennison&#174; V-6701B Series Conspicuity Tape meets the stringent requirements of the ECE 104, Class C regulation.</feature>
      <feature>Designed for use on trucks and trailers with rigid surfaces, V-6700B provides superior reflectivity and enhanced nighttime safety.</feature>
      <feature>It is a high quality, durable, microprismatic retroreflective material with a pressure sensitive adhesive. As with all our products it is of full EU origin, china is barred at SignLine.</feature>
      <feature>The single layer construction does not require edge sealing.</feature>

    <title>Carbon Effect Cast Wrap Film from SignLine.</title>
    <product_body>A high grade of film, very nice carbon effect, gloss finish.
If you bought 5000 metres of this branded, EU origin film, you would still be paying twice as much per metre than what BESTWAYTOYOU are saying they can sell it for. Fraudulent listing by BESTWAY. If you want to pass all our wealth to China buying sub standard materials then there are many (the majority) of other sellers for you. If you want High grades of branded materials of EU origin and are willing to pay the price for a clear conscience, then you are the clients we are here for and have been since 1994.
If you covered the whole of China, The UK &amp; The USA with trees &amp; let them grow to maturity over 25+ years &amp;
never cut them down, you wouldn't neutralise even one year's worth of pollution buying products from China. 
Morally &amp; ethically we cannot justify it here at SignLine regardless of any monetary savings, there is no monetary saving that justifies the destruction of the environment of our planet and all the life that it supports.

Therefore we do not supply any materials manufactured in the far east from undemocratic countries, that have few human rights and absolutely no animal welfare, skinning animals like cats and dogs while they are still alive, and they remain alive afterwards too, if only for a short, painful time, or the same countries that do not have to meet all the stringent regulations and standards to protect consumers and the environment as we have to do in the UK and the rest of Europe.

China accounts for 95% of all elephant poaching, slaughtered for their ivory, a recent haul in Africa of ivory bound for China contained the tusks of over 700 elephants, with all the wealth transferred to China based on their cheap prices the Chinese are now building in Africa and living there too, accelerating the demise of our planets largest land mammal and it's environment.</product_body>

    <title>Avery Dennison Conspicuity Tape, For Flexible Surfaces, V-6772 B Red</title>
    <product_body>Many accidents are avoidable if the driver of the other vehicle had only been able to detect the truck. Reflective contour markings on trucks make detection easy, giving drivers time to see a vehicle, react and avoid a collision. In fact, NHTSA studies demonstrate 41 percent reduction in side and rear trailer impact when using conspicuity tape. Avery Dennison V-6700B Series Conspicuity Tape provides superior reflectivity and may help reduce accidents, prevent injuries and can decrease related costs such as repairs, insurance expenses and fees.</product_body>
    <features>
      <feature>Avery Dennison&#174; V-6750B Series Conspicuity Tape meets the stringent requirements of the ECE 104, Class C regulation.</feature>
      <feature>Designed for use on PVC curtain sided vehicles, V-6750B provides superior reflectivity and enhanced night time safety.</feature>
      <feature>It is a high quality, durable, microprismatic retro reflective material with a pressure sensitive adhesive.</feature>
      <feature>The single layer construction does not require edge sealing.</feature>

    <title>Pig Board, 600mm x 600mm x 10mm, White.</title>
    <product_body>Designed and produced in Norfolk by SignLine. We use our cnc router to cut these to shape, the machine is capable of cutting to any shape or font. All materials we use are of full EU origin, no Chinese rubbish here (you're barred!). Boards are easy to keep clean. They can be decorated as we did in one of the sample photo's but that would be for an additional charge. We also produce herd boards from the same materials. Pig boards are also available in 900mm x 600mm as in photo with our young lad holding one.</product_body>
