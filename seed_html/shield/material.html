<h1>Material</h1>
<p>Nano-Fusion Protection is a patent-pending film technology that makes existing topcoats obsolete.</p>

<p>A topcoat is a layer of generally stiffer material laminated to a flexible urethane film base. Current topcoats make PPFs more difficult to install and weather poorly over time. There can be separation at the boundary, causing crazing and stress cracking, which really affects the appearance.</p>

<p>Nano-Fusion Technology infuses the urethane film with clear penetrating protection. Nano-Fusion PPF is more conformable, easier to install, retains its gloss, and resists yellowing and cracking better than other films on the market.</p>

<p>The proof is provided by the best warranty in the business: Nano-Fusion Protection is backed by a 7-year warranty.</p>
