<h1>Easy Installation</h1>
<p>Because there is no stiff topcoat to contend with, installing Nano-Fusion Protection™ film is easier…</p>
<ul>
<li>More conformable, easier to work onto the contours of the vehicle’s surface</li>
<li>More flexible—compresses and expands easily for smooth finishing on any install</li>
<li>More tackable—the adhesive is designed to tack and hold using the alcohol solution—60/40 solution of water (60) and 70% isopropyl alcohol (40)</li>
<li>Easy release—using the soap (slip) solution—3 drops of baby shampoo in a quart of water—as needed to achieve the best install possible</li>
<li>More positionable—with the soap (slip) solution the film lifts up and can be positioned readily and as often as needed for the best fit.</li>
<li>Same Tools, Better Outcome</li>
</ul>
<p>You just need a soap (slip) solution and alcohol solution (see training video), squeegees and lint free towels, plus the appropriate film pattern for the vehicle. A typical install takes about an hour.</p>
