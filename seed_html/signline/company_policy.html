<p>item, drawings/designs produced by SignLine for the Customer.</p>

<p>on full &amp; final payment of relative invoices.</p>

<p>If these terms are broken SignLine will issue you an invoice for the drawings.</p>
<p>CONFIDENTIALITY - Both parties undertake to keep confidential all information which is either
designated as confidential by the disclosing party, or which is by its nature to be regarded as confidential whether written or oral, that its respective employees, agents or sub-contractors shall have obtained or received in the course of negotiations or completing the contract.</p>
<p>Disclosing prices or our designs &amp; layouts to our competitors is deemed in breach of the above.</p>
<p>FORCE MAJEURE - Neither party will be liable to the other party for any delay, or failure to perform its obligations, as a result of any cause beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to, any industrial dispute.</p>
<p>NOTICES - Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be given hereunder shall be deliveredby hand, or sent by first class post, or emailed to the addressee's registered office.</p>
<p>COMPLIANCE WITH RULES AND REGULATIONS - SignLine shall ensure that when any of its obligations are performed on the Customer's premises, all reasonable rules and regulations in force, and made known by the Customer to SignLine, are complied with by SignLine.</p>
<p>PRICES &amp; PAYMENT - Account Holders: On confirmation, from the customer to proceed with at the agreed costings SignLine will issue an invoice shortly after delivery or fitting of the finished product for the outstanding balance. </p>
<p>Non Account holders: Where the price is a known we will issue an invoice which needs to be paid in full before commencing of works, any additional costs will be invoiced separately after completion.</p>
<p>Estimates, these are provided when we do not know what the final cost will be, an estimate is just that, a best guess, an approximation, the final cost can vary significantly, up to and including over 100%. If you wish to limit this you can with prior notification to us so we can let you know when we have reached the estimated cost and if you wish us to continue we can or we can stop at that point. All final costs are based exactly on materials and time taken to complete the job, you pay only for all the works carried out, we get paid for all the works we have carried out. This is fairer than a quote as if we quote and we take longer to complete we lose out, if we don't take as long to complete the client loses out, some types of work we cannot quote as we just don't know what the final cost will be.</p>
<p>Quotes and estimates are vaild for 30 days from the date they are given, we reserve the right to increase or decrease prices if you order after this period. The price difference a short period after this time would be minimal if any, or it could increase over months and years, i.e. some clients order 2 years after a quote or estimate was given so the price may of gone up significantly after a period of this length.</p> 
<p>Any issues with any invoices or payments must be brought to our attention within 7 working days of receipt, we will investigate any claims and reply within 7 working days, any further complaints or replies to the outcome of the investigation must be made within 7 working days, after this period we will assume the claim or query has been satisfied.</p>

At such a time as a written notice to cancel the contract is received by SignLine an invoice will be issued to the Customer for any work completed to date based on a reasonable hourly rate &amp; materials processed &amp; work already undertaken. Upon cancellation of the contract or order for any reason, the Customer must destroy all relating information supplied by SignLine on the product whether in written or electronic form.</p>
<p>NON-PAYMENT - In the event of non-payment by the Customer, SignLine, at its discretion, may elect to treat the contract or order as cancelled or continue the contract or leave products in place as long as it sees fit and seek continuingor final payment from the Customer until the contract or order is cancelled by the customer in accordance with these Conditions.</p>
