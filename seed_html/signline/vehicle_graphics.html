<p>We produce and fit vehicle graphics from our standard Avery 700 New Generatio Premium Film, the full specification is available on our Information on Materials page.</p>
<p>In short, a high performance, 64 micron film with permanent adhesive suitable for application to Windows, Vehicles, Panels or anything with a semi-gloss/gloss finish.</p>
<p>Available in 120 standard colours or pantone matched where a minimum quantity would apply.</p>
<p>It does have a longer life than maybe what is required but it is far superior to a 5 year (5-7 year) film of any brand, 40% more life for around the same price.</p>
<p>Our superior film has guarantee’s for Metallics of 5 years, Colours of 7 years, black and white of 8 years, we have been back to jobs we used this film on over a decade ago and they still look great although at worst some may of marginally faded.</p>
<p>This film can be cut to any font, logo or graphic in one piece up to 1600mm, tiled thereafter.</p>
<p>This means we can produce text from 4mm to any size in any of our 5,000 in house fonts.</p>
<p>We also use digital printing for vehicle graphics, from small full 
colour logo’s through to photo’s wrapped on your vehicle, examples of which you 
can also see under digital printing and vehicle wrapping.</p>
<p>Digital is also used if a particular colour for text is not available in coloured film and in that case we can print the colour to white film, and contour cut it to shape after it has been laminated.</p>
<p>All of which can be applied to a single panel on a motorbike to an articulated lorry in our temperature controlled units, this gives us and our clients a big advantage in that at any time of the year graphics can be fitted to your vehicle at the manufacturers specifications, any supplier without this facility would generally simply apply the graphics anyway, which if so at worst are only bound to fail, or at least have a much shorter life.</p>
<p>We also use more specialised films for application to curtain siders and recovery vehicles being able to offer standard Chapter 8 kits through to bespoke kits for a particular vehicle or non standard area's to be covered for Great Britain through to meeting regulations in Europe which differ to our own.</p>
