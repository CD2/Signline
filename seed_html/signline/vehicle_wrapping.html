<p>Windows are a great area to use for advertising, in most cases providing larger area's for signage, digital prints and graphics.</p>
<p>We supply and fit frost and etch effect films to obscure glass or provide decoration, patches that have text and logos cut out of them exposing the glass to convey a message, promote your company, brand and provide some privacy at the same time if required.</p>
<p>Window tint we utilise to give security, privacy, reduction in sun glare and reduce heat too.</p>
<p>We stock a vast range of different tint films, for automotive use through to those suitable for conservatories, different films for different applications by their design.</p>
<p>Car window tinting is something we provide for all types of vehicles from works vans to high end cars using either pre-cut kits to save time and cost if they are available for a particular vehicle, if not we template and create our own.</p>
<p>Installing window film on curved rear screens is an art in itself and we tend to use the heat shrink method where the film is shrunk to fit the curve for a better fit.</p>
