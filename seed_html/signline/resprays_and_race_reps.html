<p>Resprays, Race Replica’s, using spray booths we can paint any vehicle from a motorcycle panel to a complete coach, we can use straight paints, metallics, iridescent or as they are mainly known as flip flop colours and pearlescent.</p>
<p>To compliment this service we also can finish the job with new graphics for coaches or race replica kits for motorcycles, these are not the cheap, poor quality &amp; poor representations you can get off Bay co’s, these are professional, precise reproductions using the best materials ensuring the best end result.</p>
<p>For complete protection not available in spray we recommend protecting areas prone to stone chips and damage with Shield &amp; Protect Paint Protection Film.</p>
